BhMiwEP5ZM7,QUASER: Question Answering with Scalable Extractive Rationalization,"Designing NLP models that produce predictions by first extracting a set of relevant input sentences (i.e., rationales), is gaining importance as a means to improving model interpretability and to producing supporting evidence for users. Current unsupervised approaches are trained to extract rationales that maximize prediction accuracy, which is invariably obtained by exploiting spurious correlations in datasets, and leads to unconvincing rationales. In this paper, we introduce unsupervised generative models to extract dual-purpose rationales, which must not only be able to support a subsequent answer prediction, but also support a reproduction of the input query. We show that such models can produce more meaningful rationales, that are less influenced by dataset artifacts, and as a result, also achieve the state-of-the-art on rationale extraction metrics on four datasets from the ERASER benchmark, significantly improving upon previous unsupervised methods.",may,True,-1.338083101081419,-4.880841080846323

bGjFXO6osc4,"Update Frequently, Update Fast: Retraining Semantic Parsing Systems in a Fraction of Time","Currently used semantic parsing systems deployed in voice assistants can require weeks to train. Datasets for these models often receive small and frequent updates, data patches. Each patch requires training a new model. To reduce training time, one can fine-tune the previously trained model on each patch, but naive fine-tuning exhibits catastrophic forgetting -- degradation of the model performance on the data not represented in the data patch.  In this work, we propose a simple method that alleviates catastrophic forgetting and show that it is possible to match the performance of a model trained from scratch in less than 10\% of a time via fine-tuning. The key to achieving this is supersampling and EWC regularization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple splits of the Facebook TOP and SNIPS datasets.",may,True,4.352905832300805,-14.52731304580326

JZy4chxCF7X,How to Query Language Models?,"Large pre-trained language models (LMs) are capable of not only recovering linguistic but also factual and commonsense knowledge. To access the knowledge stored in mask-based LMs, we can use cloze-style questions and let the model fill in the blank.  The flexibility advantage over structured knowledge bases comes with the drawback of finding the right query for a certain information need. Inspired by human behavior to disambiguate a question, we propose to query LMs by example. To clarify the ambivalent question \textit{Who does Neuer play for?}, a successful strategy is to demonstrate the relation using another subject, e.g., \textit{Ronaldo plays for Portugal. Who does Neuer play for?}. We apply this approach of querying by example to the LAMA probe and obtain substantial improvements of up to 37.8\% for BERT-large on the T-REx data when providing only 10 demonstrations---even outperforming a baseline that queries the model with up to 40 paraphrases of the question. The examples are provided through the model's context and thus require neither fine-tuning nor an additional forward pass. This suggests that LMs contain more factual and commonsense knowledge than previously assumed---if we query the model in the right way.",may,True,-0.9078586971640898,-18.431199538802378

RvO9DqoWI9V,Contrastive Conditioning for Assessing Disambiguation in MT: A Case Study of Distilled Bias,"Lexical disambiguation is a major challenge for machine translation systems, especially if some senses of a word are trained less often than others. Identifying patterns of overgeneralization requires evaluation methods that are both reliable and scalable. We propose contrastive conditioning as a reference-free black-box method for detecting disambiguation errors. Specifically, we score the quality of a translation by conditioning on variants of the source that provide contrastive disambiguation cues. After validating our method, we apply it in a case study to perform a targeted evaluation of sequence-level knowledge distillation. By probing word sense disambiguation and translation of gendered occupation names, we show that distillation-trained models tend to overgeneralize more than other models with a comparable BLEU score. Contrastive conditioning thus highlights a side effect of distillation that is not fully captured by standard evaluation metrics.

Robust numerical reasoning likewise faces unique challenges in this domain. In this work, we focus on answering deep questions over financial data, aiming to automate the analysis of a large corpus of financial documents. In contrast to existing tasks on general domain, the finance domain includes complex numerical reasoning and understanding of heterogeneous representations. To facilitate analytical progress, we propose a new large-scale dataset, FinQA, with Question-Answering pairs over Financial reports, written by financial experts. We also annotate the gold reasoning programs to ensure full explainability. We further introduce baselines and conduct comprehensive experiments in our dataset. The results demonstrate that popular, large, pre-trained models fall far short of expert humans in acquiring finance knowledge and in complex multi-step numerical reasoning on that knowledge.

In clinical medicine and other high-risk settings, domain experts may be unwilling to trust model predictions without explanations. Work in explainable AI must balance competing objectives along two different axes: 1) Models should ideally be both accurate and simple. 2) Explanations must balance faithfulness to the model's decision-making with their plausibility to a domain expert. We propose to train a proxy model that mimics the behavior of a trained model and provides control over these trade-offs. We evaluate our approach on the task of assigning ICD codes to clinical notes to demonstrate that the proxy model is faithful to the trained model's behavior and produces quality explanations.",may,True,28.703590864248937,3.510562386455553

Comparing existing regulatory regimes for hate speech, we base our investigation on the European Union's framework as it provides a widely applicable legal minimum standard. Accurately judging whether a post is punishable or not usually requires legal training. We show that, by breaking the legal assessment down into a series of simpler sub-decisions, even laypersons can annotate consistently. Based on a newly annotated dataset, our experiments show that directly learning an automated model of punishable content is challenging. However, learning the two sub-tasks of `target group' and `targeting conduct' instead of an end-to-end approach to punishability yields better results. Overall, our method also provides for better explainability and higher transparency, which is a crucial point in legal decision-making.",may,True,-32.07653152737964,-16.06930450805909

The resulting task embeddings enable a novel analysis of the relatedness among tasks. We also show that task aspects can be used to predict task embeddings for new tasks without using any annotated examples. Predicted embeddings can modulate the encoder for zero-shot inference and outperform a zero-shot baseline on GLUE tasks. The provided multitask setup can function as a benchmark for future transfer learning research.    ",may,True,1.6030497106861548,-25.13892608748343

The task of Aspect and Opinion Term Extraction presents a special challenge for domain transfer: while opinion terms largely transfer across domains, aspects change drastically from one domain to another (e.g. from \textit{restaurants} to \textit{laptops}).  In this paper, we investigate and establish empirically a prior conjecture, which suggests that the linguistic relations connecting opinion terms to their aspects transfer well across domains and therefore can be leveraged for cross-domain aspect term extraction. We present several analyses supporting this conjecture, via experiments with four linguistic dependency formalisms to represent relation patterns.  Following, we present an aspect term extraction method that drives models to consider opinion--aspect relations via explicit multitask objectives.  This method provides significant performance gains, even on top of a prior state-of-the-art linguistically-informed model, which are shown in analysis to stem from the relational pivoting signal.

Recent work explores using such layers for neural machine translation (NMT), to adapt pre-trained models to new domains or language pairs. We propose strategies to compose language and domain adapters. Our goals are both parameter-efficient adaptation to multiple domains and languages simultaneously, and cross-lingual transfer in domains where parallel data is unavailable for certain language pairs. We find that a naive combination of domain-specific and language-specific adapters often results in translations into the wrong language. We study other ways to combine the adapters to alleviate this issue and maximize cross-lingual transfer. With our best adapter combinations, we obtain improvements of 3-4 BLEU on average for source languages that do not have in-domain data. For target languages without in-domain data, we achieve a similar improvement by combining adapters with back-translation.",may,True,12.158036326236038,-19.79119989175858

While defense strategies have been extensively explored in the computer vision domain, research in natural language processing still lacks techniques to make models resilient to adversarial text inputs. We propose an adversarial detector leveraging Shapley additive explanations against text attacks. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art detector by around 19% F1-score on the IMDb and 14% on the SST-2 datasets while also showing competitive performance on AG_News and Yelp Polarity.

3E3F51B8azH,GeDi: Generative Discriminator Guided Sequence Generation,"While large-scale language models (LMs) are able to imitate the distribution of natural language well enough to generate realistic text, it is difficult to control which regions of the distribution they generate. This is especially problematic because datasets used for training large LMs usually contain significant toxicity, hate, bias, and negativity. One promising approach to address this is to use discriminators to guide decoding from LMs, but existing methods for this are too slow to be useful in practice for many applications. We present GeDi as a significantly more efficient discriminator-based approach for guiding decoding. GeDi guides generation at each step by computing classification probabilities for all possible next tokens via Bayes rule by normalizing over two class-conditional distributions; one conditioned on the desired attribute, or control code, and another conditioned on the undesired attribute, or anti control code. We find that GeDi gives controllability on par with or better than previous controllable generation methods. GeDi results in significantly faster generation speeds than the only previous method that achieved comparable controllability in our experiments. We also show that GeDi can make GPT-2 and GPT-3 significantly less toxic while maintaining linguistic fluency, without sacrificing significantly on generation speed. Lastly, we find training GeDi on only three topics allows us to controllably generate new topics zero-shot from just a keyword.",may,True,0.5954240074313335,-19.60685791721168

An Empirical Study,"The recent development of knowledge embedding (KE) enables machines to represent knowledge graphs (KGs) with low-dimensional embeddings, which facilitates utilizing KGs for various downstream natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. However, less work has been done on systematically evaluating the impact of KE on NLU. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of utilizing KE on four downstream knowledge-driven NLU tasks using two representative knowledge-guided frameworks, including knowledge augmentation and knowledge attention. From the experimental results, we find that: (1) KE models that have better performance on knowledge graph completion do not necessarily help knowledge-driven NLU tasks better in the knowledge-guided frameworks; (2) KE could effectively benefit NLU tasks from two aspects including entity similarity and entity relation information; (3) KE could further benefit pre-trained language models which have already learned rich knowledge from pre-training. We hope the results could help and guide future studies to utilize KE in NLU tasks. Our source code will be released to support further exploration.",may,True,-39.666762279222596,2.579575159613953

The field has advanced considerably during the past two years, benefiting from the proliferation of pre-trained Language Models (LMs). However, the field is constrained by two factors: 1) the absence of an effective automatic evaluation metric and 2) a lack of effective architectures for long document summarization. Our first contribution is to demonstrate that a set of semantic evaluation metrics (BERTScore, MoverScore and our novel metric, BARTScore) consistently and significantly outperform ROUGE. Using these metrics, we then show that combining transformers with sparse self-attention is a successful method for long document summarization and is very competitive with the state of the art.

Systems that could assist in GEP, such as language models, are expected to predict elements and therefore prevent grammatical errors in advance. Our findings show that GPT-2 can predict 29% of the correct tokens with one prediction. Accuracy rises up to 44% when the top 3 predictions are considered. To test the pedagogical capacity of such a model, we also experimented with real English as a second language (ESL) learners.

These training settings expose the encoder and the decoder in a machine translation model with different data distributions. In this paper, we examine how different varieties of multilingual training contribute to learning these two components of the MT model. Specifically, we compare bilingual models with encoders and/or decoders initialized by multilingual training. We show that multilingual training is beneficial to encoders in general, while it only benefits decoders for low-resource languages (LRLs). We further find the important attention heads for each language pair and compare their correlations during inference. Our analysis sheds light on how multilingual translation models work and also enables us to propose methods to improve performance by training with highly related languages.

In particular, we find that these models misclassify on augmented sentences that have been negated or strengthened in terms of their causal meaning. This is worrying because minor linguistic changes in causal sentences can have disparate meanings. To resolve such issues, we propose to generate counterfactual causal sentences by creating contrast sets (Gardner et al., 2020). However, we notice an important finding that simply introducing edits is not sufficient to train models with counterfactuals. We thus introduce heuristics, like sentence shortening or multiplying key causal terms, to emphasize semantically important keywords to the model. We demonstrate these findings on different training setups and across two out-of-domain corpora. Our proposed mixture of augmented edits consistently achieves improved performance compared to baseline across two models and both within and out of corpus' domain, suggesting our proposed augmentation also helps the model generalize.",may,True,-1.7277532588811046,8.53467829249356

However, sensitive personal information, such as documents with people's profiles or relationships as edges, are prone to privacy leaks, as the trained model might reveal the original input. Although differential privacy (DP) offers a well-founded privacy-preserving framework, GCNs pose theoretical and practical challenges due to their training specifics. We address these challenges by adapting differentially-private gradient-based training to GCNs and conduct experiments using two optimizers on five NLP datasets in two languages. We propose a simple yet efficient method based on random graph splits that not only improves the baseline privacy bounds by a factor of 2.7 while retaining competitive $F_1$ scores, but also provides strong privacy guarantees of $\varepsilon = 1.0$.

In experiments across twelve NLU tasks, we discover a consistent block diagonal structure in the similarity of representations within fine-tuned RoBERTa and ALBERT models, with strong similarity within clusters of earlier and later layers, but not between them. The similarity of later layer representations implies that later layers only marginally contribute to task performance, and we verify in experiments that the top few layers of fine-tuned Transformers can be discarded without hurting performance, even with no further tuning.

Recent approaches to solve this task involve leveraging transformer based masked language models that are pre-trained on NL and PL and fine-tuned for code search using a contrastive learning objective. However, these approaches suffer from uninformative in-batch negative samples.  We propose DyHardCode: a contrastive learning framework that leverages hard negative examples, which are mined globally from the entire training corpus to improve the quality of code and natural language representations. We experiment with different hard negative mining strategies, and provide explanations to the effectiveness of our method from the perspectives of optimization and adversarial learning. We show that DyHardCode leads to improvements in multiple code search tasks.

lZF0Gyu1thp,Active Evaluation: Efficient NLG Evaluation with Few Pairwise Comparisons,"Recent studies have shown the advantages of evaluating NLG systems using pairwise comparisons as opposed to direct assessment. Given $k$ systems, a naive approach for identifying the top-ranked system would be to uniformly obtain pairwise comparisons from all ${k \choose 2}$ pairs of systems. However, this can be very expensive as the number of human annotations required would grow quadratically with $k$. In this work, we introduce Active Evaluation, a framework to efficiently identify the top-ranked system by actively choosing system pairs for comparison using dueling bandit algorithms. We perform extensive experiments with 13 dueling bandits algorithms on 13 NLG evaluation datasets spanning 5 tasks and show that the number of human annotations can be reduced by 80%. To further reduce the number of human annotations, we propose model-based dueling bandit algorithms which combine automatic evaluation metrics with human evaluations. Specifically, we eliminate sub-optimal systems even before the human annotation process and perform human evaluations only on test examples where the automatic metric is highly uncertain. This reduces the number of human annotations required further by 89%. In effect, we show that identifying the top-ranked system requires only a few hundred human annotations, which grow linearly with $k$. Lastly, we provide practical recommendations and best practices to identify the top-ranked system efficiently. ",june,True,0.795876807892913,-7.250282872326088

Since continuation is in fact a sub-task of fill in the blank, one where the blank is placed at the sequence's end, we propose the training of a single model which can effectively handle both these tasks.

The most challenging part for machine learning methods is the skewed label distribution in which a majority of labels receive very few training instances (named as the tail labels). Benchmark evaluations so far have focused on micro-averaging metrics, where the performance on tail labels can be easily overshadowed by high-frequency labels (named as head labels), and hence they are insufficient for evaluating the true success of methods in XMTC.  This paper presents a re-evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on the binned macro-averaging F1  instead, which reveals new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of representative methods.  Based on the evaluation, we conduct in-depth analysis and experiments on Transformer models with various depths and attention mechanisms to improve the tail label performance.

To improve the coherence of generated narratives and to expand the scope of character-centric narrative generation, we introduce Commonsense-inference Augmented neural StoryTelling (CAST), a framework for introducing commonsense reasoning into the generation process while modeling the interaction between multiple characters.

Toward Deeper Multi-hop Reasoning Task,"Multi-hop machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a task that requires models to read and perform multi-hop reasoning over multiple paragraphs to answer a question. The task can be used to evaluate reasoning skills, as well as to check the explainability of the models, and is useful in applications (e.g., QA system). However, the current definition of hop (alias step) in the multi-hop MRC is ambiguous; moreover, previous studies demonstrated that many multi-hop examples contain reasoning shortcuts where the questions can be solved without performing multi-hop reasoning. In this opinion paper, we redefine multi-hop MRC to solve the ambiguity of its current definition by providing three different definitions of the steps. Inspired by the assessment of student learning in education, we introduce a new term of In-depth multi-hop reasoning task with three additional evaluations: step evaluation, coreference evaluation, and entity linking evaluation. In addition, we also examine the existing multi-hop datasets based on our proposed definitions. We observe that there is potential to extend the existing multi-hop datasets by including more intermediate evaluations to the task.

These models are usually trained on small, clean, and synthetically controlled datasets, which leads to high failure rates in presence of `unseen' background noises, promoting noise-overlay based adversarial attacks. Noisy data augmentation has aided robustness of speech recognition and classification models, wherein, the ground truth label remains consistent even in the presence of noise which, isn't always true for subjectively perceived emotion labels. In this work, we create realistic noisy samples of IEMOCAP, using multiple categories of environmental and synthetic noise. We evaluate how ground truth labels (human) and predicted labels (model) change as a function of these noise source introductions. We show that some commonly used noisy augmentation techniques, impact human perception of emotion, thus, falsifying the `clean ground truth label. Our experiments show that the performance of both, baseline, and even denoised emotion recognition models significantly declines on noisy samples as compared to that on the clean set. This performance degradation prevails when model is trained on a combination of clean and test set mismatched noisy samples. We investigate how using the above found `human-perceptible noise overlays can lead to inaccurate metrics when testing the model for robustness or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Finally, we present a set of recommendations for noise-based augmentation of speech emotion datasets and for deploying the models trained using those datasets.",june,True,-24.03386678706119,17.88262553128661

Two solutions were proposed to address the problem: (i) manual fact-checking, which is accurate and credible, but slow and non-scalable, and (ii) automatic fact-checking, which is fast and scalable, but lacks explainability and credibility. With the accumulation of enough manually fact-checked claims, a middle-ground approach has emerged: checking whether a given claim has previously been fact-checked. This can be made automatically, and thus fast, while also offering credibility and explainability, thanks to the human fact-checking and explanations in the associated fact-checking article. This is a relatively new and understudied research direction, and here we focus on claims made in a political debate, where context really matters. Thus, we study the impact of modeling the context of the claim: both on the source side, i.e., in the debate, as well as on the target side, i.e., in the fact-checking explanation document. We do this by modeling the local context, the global context, as well as by means of co-reference resolution, and reasoning over the target text using Transformer-XH.

We show the teacher network can learn to better transfer knowledge to the student network (i.e., learning to teach) with the feedback from the performance of the distilled student network in a meta learning framework. Moreover, we introduce a pilot update mechanism to improve the alignment between the inner-learner and meta-learner in meta learning algorithms that focus on an improved inner-learner. Experiments on various benchmarks show that MetaDistil can yield significant improvements compared with traditional KD algorithms and is less sensitive to the choice of different student capacity and hyperparameters, facilitating the use of KD on different tasks and models.",august,True,0.27280115214998796,-45.11851083037107

However, the term explanation encompasses a broad range of notions, each with different properties and ramifications. Our goal is to provide an overview of diverse types of explanations and human limitations, and discuss implications for collecting and using explanations in NLP. Inspired by prior work in psychology and cognitive sciences, we group existing human explanations in NLP into three categories: proximal mechanism, evidence, and procedure. These three types differ in nature and have implications for the resultant explanations. For instance, procedure is not considered explanations in psychology and connects with a rich body of work on learning from instructions. The diversity of explanations is further evidenced by proxy questions that are needed for annotators to interpret and answer open-ended why questions. Finally, explanations may require different, often deeper, understandings than predictions, which casts doubt on whether humans can provide useful explanations in some tasks.",august,True,-1.2017210836286565,-5.978157940569574

Indeed, it is natural to assume that these pre-trained representations do encode some level of linguistic knowledge as they have brought about large empirical improvements on a wide variety of NLP tasks, which suggests they are learning true linguistic generalization. In this work, we focus on intrinsic probing, an analysis technique where the goal is not only to identify whether a representation encodes a linguistic attribute, but also to pinpoint where this attribute is encoded. We propose a novel latent-variable formulation for constructing intrinsic probes and derive a tractable variational approximation to the log-likelihood. Our results show that our model is versatile and outperforms two intrinsic probes previously proposed in the literature. Finally, we find empirical evidence that pre-trained representations develop a cross-lingually entangled notion of  morphosyntax.",august,True,-6.0278871465479655,-4.304066538681729

The dependence on abundant data prevents NLP models from being applied to low-resource settings or novel tasks where significant time, money, or expertise is required to label massive amounts of textual data. Recently, data augmentation methods have been explored as a means of improving data efficiency in NLP. To date, there has been no systematic empirical overview of data augmentation for NLP in the limited labeled data setting, making it difficult to understand which methods work in which settings. In this paper, we provide an empirical survey of recent progress on data augmentation for NLP in the limited labeled data setting, summarizing the landscape of methods (including token-level augmentations, sentence-level augmentations, adversarial augmentations, and hidden-space augmentations) and carrying out experiments on 11 datasets covering topics/news classification, inference tasks, paraphrasing tasks, and single-sentence tasks.

-0pzbYBTRmt,Multimodal Knowledge Learning for Named Entity Disambiguation,"With the popularity of online social medias in recent years, massive-scale multimodal information has brought new challenges to traditional Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) tasks. Recently, Multimodal Named Entity Disambiguation (MNED) is proposed to link ambiguous mentions with the textual and visual contexts to a predefined knowledge graph.  Recent attempts handle these issues mainly by annotating multimodal mentions and adding multimodal features to traditional NED models. These methods still suffer from 1) lack of multimodal annotation data against the huge scale of unlabeled corpus  and 2) failing to model multimodal information at knowledge level. In this paper, we explore a pioneer study on leveraging multimodal knowledge learning to address the MNED task. Specifically, we propose a knowledge-guided transfer learning strategy to extract unified representation from different modalities and enrich multimodal lnowledge in a Meta Learning way which is much easier than collecting ambiguous mention corpus. Then we propose an Interactive Multimodal Learning Network (IMN), which is capable of fully utilizing the multimodal information in both mention and knowledge side. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we implemented comparisons on a public large-scale MNED dataset based on Twitter KB. Experimental results show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art multimodal methods",august,True,-26.378864868226184,-1.760939875554507

One such method operates on the encoder, through a Scene-Aware Self-Attention (SASA) head. Another on the decoder, through a Scene-Aware Cross-Attention (SACrA) head.

EkXAZcDorIa,Quantifying the Task-Specific Information in Text-Based Classifications,"Recently, neural natural language models have attained state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks, but the high performance can result from superficial, surface-level cues (Bender and Koller, 2020; Niven and Kao, 2020). These surface cues, as the ``shortcuts'' inherent in the datasets, do not contribute to the task-specific information (TSI) of the classification tasks. While it is essential to look at the model performance, it is also important to understand the datasets. In this paper, we consider this question: Apart from the information introduced by the shortcut features, how much task-specific information is required to classify a dataset? We formulate this quantity in an information-theoretic framework. While this quantity is hard to compute, we approximate it with a fast and stable method. TSI quantifies the amount of linguistic knowledge modulo a set of predefined shortcuts -- that contributes to classifying a sample from each dataset. This framework allows us to compare across datasets, saying that, apart from a set of ``shortcut features'', classifying the Multi-NLI task involves around 0.4 nats more TSI than the Quora Question Pair.",august,True,7.841839076700177,-9.294301309158035
TUsLgD-Ohfg,Reinforce Attack: Adversarial Attack against BERT with Reinforcement Learning,"Adversarial  attacks  against  textual  data  has been drawing increasing attention in both the NLP and security domains. Current successful attack methods for text typically consist of two stages: word importance ranking and word replacement.  The first stage is usually achieved by masking each word in the sentence one at a time and obtaining the resulting output probability of the target model.  The second stage involves finding synonyms to replace “vulnerable” words by the order of ranking. In this paper, we first explore the effects of employing the model explanation tool LIME to generate word importance ranking, which has the advantage of taking the local information around the word into account to obtain word importance scores.  We then propose Reinforce Attack, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to  generate  adversarial  text.   Notably,  the  attack  process  is  controlled  by  a  reward  function rather than heuristics as in previous methods  to  encourage  higher  semantic  similarity and  lower  query  costs.

Recent work has explored using counterfactually-augmented data (CAD)---data generated by minimally perturbing examples to flip the ground-truth label---to identify robust features that are invariant under distribution shift. However, empirical results using CAD for OOD generalization have been mixed. To explain this discrepancy, we draw insights from a  linear Gaussian model and demonstrate the  pitfalls of CAD. Specifically, we show that (a) while CAD is effective at identifying robust features, it may prevent the model from learning unperturbed robust features; and (b) CAD may exacerbate existing spurious correlations in the data. On two crowdsourced CAD datasets, our results  show that the lack of perturbation diversity limits their effectiveness on OOD generalization, calling for innovative crowdsourcing procedures to elicit diverse perturbation of examples.",august,True,6.28212939986306,-7.351713697978875

Currently, V&L models are evaluated on tasks such as visual question answering or visual reasoning, which do not address their fine-grained linguistic capabilities. VALSE addresses this gap by offering a suite of six tests targeting specific linguistic phenomena. Solving these tests requires models to ground these  phenomena in the visual modality, allowing more fine-grained evaluations than hitherto possible. We build VALSE using methods that support the construction of reliable foils, and report results from evaluating five widely-used V&L models. Our experiments suggest that current models have considerable difficulty addressing most phenomena. Hence, we expect VALSE to serve as an important benchmark to measure future progress of pretrained V&L models from a linguistic perspective, complementing the canonical task-centred V&L evaluations.",august,True,35.3750725061259,-6.395181487791757

Then we systematically compare these different strategies across multiple tasks and domains.

Deduplication allows us to train models that emit memorized text ten times less frequently and require fewer training steps to achieve the same or better accuracy.

The scarcity of gold standard code-mixed to pure language parallel data makes it difficult to train a translation model that can perform this task reliably. Prior work has addressed the paucity of parallel data with data augmentation techniques. Such techniques rely heavily on external resources, which make the systems difficult to train and scale effectively for multiple languages. We present a simple yet highly effective training scheme for adapting multilingual models to the task of code-mixed translation. Our method eliminates the dependence on external resources by creating synthetic data from a novel two-stage back-translation approach that we propose.

With unlikelihood training, Tailor's generator is designed to follow a series of control codes derived from semantic roles. Through modifications of these control codes, Tailor can produce fine-grained perturbations. We implement a set of operations on control codes that can be composed into complex perturbation strategies, and demonstrate their effectiveness in three applications. First, Tailor facilitates the construction of high-quality contrast sets that are lexically diverse and less biased than original task test data. Second, paired with automated labeling heuristics, Tailor helps improve model generalization through data augmentation: we obtain an average gain of 1.73 on an (natural language inference) NLI challenge set by perturbing just $\sim5\%$ of training data. Third, without any finetuning overhead, Tailor's perturbations effectively improve compositionality in fine-grained style transfer, outperforming fine-tuned baselines on 5 transfers.",august,True,11.53315610541256,-9.176340911893519

Particularly, previous studies suggest that prompt-tuning has remarkable superiority in the low-data scenario over the generic fine-tuning methods with extra classifiers. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces, i.e., template, to the input and transform a classification problem into a masked language modeling problem, where a crucial step is to construct a projection, i.e., verbalizer, between a label space and a label word space. A verbalizer is usually handcrafted or searched by gradient descent, which may lack coverage and bring considerable bias and high variances to the results. In this work, we focus on incorporating external knowledge into the verbalizer, forming a knowledgeable prompt-tuning (KPT), to improve and stabilize prompt-tuning. Specifically, we expand the label word space of the verbalizer using external knowledge bases (KBs) and refine the expanded label word space with the PLM itself before predicting with the expanded label word space.

lZTBTihUdlc,Widely Interpretable Semantic Representation: Frameless Meaning Representation for Broader Applicability,"This paper presents a semantic representation called WISeR that overcomes challenges for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Despite its richness and exapandability, AMR is not easily applied to languages or domains without predefined semantic frames, and its use of numbered arguments results in semantic role labels which are not directly interpretable and are semantically overloaded for parsers. We examine the numbered arguments of predicates in AMR and convert them to thematic roles which do not require reference to semantic frames. We create a new corpus of 1K dialogue sentences annotated in both WISeR and AMR.

32tW2OOxJ5D,A Meta-framework for Spatiotemporal Quantity Extraction from Text,"News events are often associated with quantities (e.g., the number of COVID-19 patients or the number of arrests in a protest), and it is often important to extract their type, time, and location from unstructured text in order to analyze these quantity events. This paper thus formulates the NLP problem of spatiotemporal quantity extraction, and proposes the first meta-framework for solving it. This meta-framework contains a formalism that decomposes the problem into several information extraction tasks, a shareable crowdsourcing pipeline, and transformer-based baseline models. We demonstrate the meta-framework in three domains---the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, and 2020 California wildfires---to show that the formalism is general and extensible, the crowdsourcing pipeline facilitates fast and high-quality data annotation, and the baseline system can handle spatiotemporal quantity extraction well enough to be practically useful.

We introduce the Alignment Augmented Constrained Translation (AACTrans) model to translate English sentences and their corresponding extractions consistently with each other --- with no changes to vocabulary or semantic meaning which may result from independent translations. Using the data generated with AACTrans, we train a novel two-stage generative OpenIE model, which we call Gen2OIE, that outputs for each sentence: 1) relations in the first stage and 2) all extractions containing the relation in the second stage. Gen2OIE increases relation coverage using a training data transformation technique that is generalizable to multiple languages, in contrast to existing models that use an English-specific training loss.

Good online alignments facilitate important applications such as lexically constrained translation where user-defined dictionaries are used to inject lexical constraints into the translation model. We propose a novel posterior alignment technique that is truly online in its execution and superior in terms of alignment error rates compared to existing methods. Our proposed inference technique jointly considers alignment and token probabilities in a principled manner and can be seamlessly integrated within existing constrained beam-search decoding algorithms.  On five language pairs, including two distant language pairs, we achieve consistent drop in alignment error rates. When deployed on three lexically constrained translation tasks, we achieve significant improvements in BLEU specifically around the constrained positions. We show that our alignment guided constrained inference yields additional benefits of fluency with negligible additional computational costs. ",september,True,28.82910490704505,-24.228367866165755

Generally, alignment algorithms only use  bitext and do not make use of the fact that many parallel corpora are multiparallel. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) and community detection algorithms to exploit the graph structure of multiparallel word alignments. Our GNN approach (i) utilizes information about the meaning, position and language of the input words, (ii) incorporates information from multiple parallel sentences, (iii) can remove edges from the initial alignments, and (iv) provides a prediction model that can generalize beyond the sentences it is trained on. We show that community detection algorithms can provide valuable information for multiparallel word alignment.

Previous works focus on Emotion Cause Extraction (ECE), a clause-level classification task aimed at extracting causes of certain given emotion in text. The task has been expanded to Emotion Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) that focus on extracting both emotions and corresponding causes in the context. Most existing methods for the ECPE task implement a joint model that performs extracting and matching of emotion and cause clauses simultaneously. However, we argue that different input features are needed for the two subtasks, thus sharing contextual representations may be suboptimal. In this work, we propose a pipelined approach that builds on two independent pre-trained encoders, in which the emotion extraction model only provide input features for the cause extraction model. Based on a series of careful experiments, we validate that our model can create distinct contextual representations according to specific emotional texts, and thus achieve state-of-the-art performance in both ECE and ECPE tasks, with the absolute F1 improvements of 1.5% and 4.72% over best previous works respectively.

Most recent works in this area have harnessed the language-invariant qualities displayed by pre-trained Multi-lingual Language Models (MLM). Their performance, however, reveals there is room for improvement as they mishandle delicate cross-lingual instances. We leverage the use of unlabeled data to train a Language Discriminator (LD) to discern between the source and target languages. The LD is trained in an adversarial manner so that our encoder learns to produce refined, language-invariant representations that lead to improved CLED performance. More importantly, we optimize the adversarial training by only presenting the LD with the most \textit{informative} samples. We base our intuition about \textit{what} makes a sample informative on two disparate metrics: sample similarity and event presence. Thus, we propose using Optimal Transport (OT) as a solution to naturally combine these two distinct information sources into the selection process.

Existing studies on CLS mainly focus on utilizing pipeline methods or jointly training an end-to-end model through an auxiliary MT or MS objective. However, it is very challenging for the model to directly conduct CLS as it requires both the abilities to translate and summarize. Besides, the processes of MT and MS have a hierarchical relationship with CLS. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical model for the CLS task, based on the conditional variational auto-encoder. The hierarchical model contains two kinds of latent variables at the local and global levels, respectively. At the local level, there are two latent variables, one for translation and the other for summarization. As for the global level, there is another latent variable for cross-lingual summarization conditioned on the two local-level variables. Experiments on two language directions (English-Chinese) verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, yielding state-of-the-art performances.

While All-MLP architectures have demonstrated reasonable performance in computer vision and garnered recent interest, we argue that making them effective in NLP applications is still an uphill battle. Hence, there may be no solid reason to drop the self-attention modules altogether. In this paper, we propose a new Mixer-Transformer architecture, showing that Transformers and Mixer models can be quite complementary indeed. Fundamentally, we show that Mixer models are capable of acting as persistent global memory (in a similar vein to standard MLPs) while being imbued with global receptive fields at the same time. Hence, interleaving sample-dependent and input-local self-attention with persistent Mixer modules can be an effective strategy. Additionally, we propose compositional remixing, a new way of baking compositional operators (multiplicative and subtractive composition) within the mixing process to improve the expressiveness of the model. This allows us to effectively model relationships between unmixed and mixed representations - an inductive bias that we postulate is powerful for NLU applications. Via extensive experiments on 14 challenging NLU datasets (e.g., SuperGLUE, entailment and compositional generalization), we show that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms a strong T5 baseline (Raffel et al.).

The trained model can then be directly applied to target languages to ""generate"" arguments in the target languages to fill in the template.

Ch1K-07jfmy,Towards Overcoming Practical Obstacles to Deploying Deep Active Learning,"Active learning (AL) is a prominent technique for reducing the annotation effort required for training machine learning models. Deep learning offers a solution for several essential obstacles to deploying AL in practice but introduces many others. One of such problems is the excessive computational resources required to train an acquisition model and estimate its uncertainty on instances in the unlabeled pool. We propose two techniques that tackle this issue for text classification and tagging tasks, offering a substantial reduction of AL iteration duration and the computational overhead introduced by deep acquisition models in AL. We also demonstrate that our algorithm that leverages pseudolabeling and distilled models overcomes one of the obstacles revealed previously in the literature. Namely, it was shown that due to differences between an acquisition model used to select instances during AL and a successor model trained on the labeled data, the benefits of AL can diminish. We show that our algorithm, despite using a smaller and faster acquisition model, is capable of training a more expressive successor with higher performance.",september,True,-13.303894538233513,-41.44470555122669

6zZEZD2LsxW,AMR-to-text Generation with Graph Structure Reconstruction and Coverage,"Generating text from semantic representations such as AMR is a challenging task. Previous research formalizes this task as a graph-to-sequence learning problem and uses various graph neural networks to model the graph structure. Recently, methods based on pre-trained models improve the performance significantly due to pre-trained on a large text corpus. However, these pre-trained model-based methods take linearized AMR graphs as input and may lose the information of graph structure.  In addition, these methods don't consider the coverage of the AMR graph. Therefore, some nodes in the graph may be lost or repeated in the generated text. To address these problems, we propose a graph structure and coverage enhanced model for this task. To enhance the information of graph structure, we design two auxiliary objectives, relationship prediction and distance prediction of nodes in AMR graphs. To consider the coverage of AMR graphs, we design a coverage mechanism to solve the problem of information under-translation or over-translation in AMR-to-text generation.   Experimental results on three standard datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods significantly.",september,True,2.0733726879841243,3.74411582878044

Deep learning models have thrived in the non-sequential learning paradigm; however, when used to learn a sequence of tasks, they fail to retain past knowledge and learn incrementally. We propose a novel approach to lifelong learning of language tasks based on meta-learning with sparse experience replay that directly optimizes to prevent forgetting. We show that under the realistic setting of performing a single pass on a stream of tasks and without any task identifiers, our method obtains state-of-the-art results on lifelong text classification and relation extraction.

We find that LERC out-performs the other methods in some settings while remaining statistically indistinguishable from lexical overlap in others.

In this paper, we measure the gender portrayal of central domains of social life as depicted in highly influential children's books using word co-occurrence and word embeddings. We find that females are more likely than males to be associated with words related both to family and appearance, while males are more associated with business-related words. The gender associations with appearance and business have endured over time, whereas family word associations have become more gender-neutral. We make two main contributions: one, we create a word embeddings data set, StoryWords 1.0, of 100 years of award-winning children's literature, and two, we show inequality in the portrayal of gender in this literature, which in turn may convey messages to children about differential roles in society.

idyspdwviWr,A Few-Shot Semantic Parser for Wizard-of-Oz Dialogues with the Precise ThingTalk+ Representation,"Previous attempts to build effective semantic parsers for Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) conversations suffer from the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality, manually annotated training set. Approaches based only on dialogue synthesis are insufficient as dialogues generated from state-machine based models are poor approximations of real-life conversations. Furthermore, previously proposed dialogue state representations are ambiguous and lack the precision necessary for building an effective agent.  This paper proposes a new dialogue representation and a sample-efficient methodology that can predict precise dialogue states in WOZ conversations. We propose a precise, complete, and executable dialogue representation called ThingTalk+, which captures all information an agent needs to respond properly. Our training strategy is sample-efficient: we combine (1) few-shot data sparsely sampling the full dialogue space and (2) synthesized data covering a subset space of dialogues generated by a succinct state-based dialogue model. The completeness of the ThingTalk+ language is demonstrated with a fully operational agent, which is also used in training data synthesis.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on MultiWOZ 3.0, a reannotation of the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset in ThingTalk+. ThingTalk+ can represent 98% of the test turns, while the simulator can emulate 85% of the validation set. We train a contextual semantic parser using our strategy, and obtain 79% turn-by-turn exact match accuracy on the reannotated test set.",september,True,-10.59778365284382,10.269102455351723

We explore data augmentation on hard tasks (i.e., few-shot natural language understanding) and strong baselines (i.e., pretrained models with over one billion parameters). Under this setting, we reproduced a large number of previous augmentation methods and found that these methods bring marginal gains at best and sometimes degrade the performance much. To address this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation method FlipDA that jointly uses a generative model and a classifier to generate label-flipped data. Central to the idea of FlipDA is the discovery that generating label-flipped data is more crucial to the performance than generating label-preserved data. Experiments show that FlipDA achieves a good tradeoff between effectiveness and robustness---it substantially improves many tasks while not negatively affecting the others.",september,True,20.291622043330598,6.313990653415368

However, we argue that jointly adopting these two techniques can be conflicting and even leads to sub-optimal performance, since the soft label produced by label smoothing still considers the source-side words that would not appear at the target side. To address this issue, we propose Masked Label Smoothing (MLS), a new mechanism that masks the soft label probability of source-side words to zero. Simple yet effective, MLS manages to better integrate label smoothing with vocabulary sharing and hence improves the quality of the translation. Our extensive experiments show that MLS consistently yields improvement over original label smoothing on different datasets, including bilingual and multilingual translation in both BLEU and calibration scores.

By leveraging generative adversarial learning for important event classification and by assimilating knowledge based tags for improving the performance of event coreference resolution we introduce a two staged system for event timeline generation from multiple (historical) text documents. In addition, we propose a vis-timeline based visualization technique to portray the event timeline. We demonstrate our results on two very well known historical documents --  the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG) and the Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln (CWAL). Our results can be extremely helpful for historians, in advancing research in history and in understanding the socio-political landscape of a country as reflected in the writings of political leaders/scholars.

Although several refined versions, including MultiWOZ 2.1-2.4, have been published recently, there are still lots of noisy labels, especially in the training set. Besides, it is costly to rectify all the problematic annotations. In this paper, instead of improving the annotation quality further, we propose a general framework, named ASSIST (lAbel noiSe-robuSt dIalogue State Tracking), to train DST models robustly from noisy labels. ASSIST first generates pseudo labels for each sample in the training set by using an auxiliary model trained on a small clean dataset, then puts the generated pseudo labels and vanilla noisy labels together to train the primary model. We show the validity of ASSIST theoretically. Experimental results also demonstrate that ASSIST improves the joint goal accuracy of DST by up to $28.16\%$ on the initial version MultiWOZ 2.0 and $8.41\%$ on the latest version MultiWOZ 2.4, respectively.

Existing methods for news recommendation usually model user interest from historical clicked news without the consideration of candidate news. However, each user usually has multiple interests, and it is difficult for these methods to accurately match a candidate news with a specific user interest. In this paper, we present a candidate-aware user modeling method for personalized news recommendation, which can incorporate candidate news into user modeling for better matching between candidate news and user interest. More specifically, we propose a candidate-aware self-attention network that uses candidate news as guidance to model candidate-aware global user interest.

baHiTdWOUgo,Multimodal Audio-textual Architecture for Robust Spoken Language Understanding,"Tandem spoken language understanding (SLU) systems suffer from the so-called automatic speech recognition (ASR) error propagation problem. Additionally, as the ASR is not optimized to extract semantics, but solely the linguistic content, relevant semantic cues might be left out of its transcripts. In this work, we propose a multimodal language understanding (MLU) architecture to mitigate these problems. Our solution is based on two compact unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models that encode speech and text information. A fusion layer is also used to fuse audio and text embeddings. Two fusion strategies are explored: a simple concatenation of these embeddings and a cross-modal attention mechanism that learns the contribution of each modality. The first approach showed to be the optimal solution to robustly extract semantic information from audio-textual data. We found that attention is less effective at testing time when the text modality is corrupted. Our model is evaluated on three SLU datasets and robustness is tested using ASR outputs from three off-the-shelf ASR engines. Results show that the proposed approach effectively mitigates the ASR error propagation problem for all datasets.",september,True,17.04963565926598,-18.558262008182787

Which reader performs better? What are the reasons for the performance differences? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions in the setting of extractive QA tasks. We design multiple transformer-based models and different scenarios to systematically compare these two readers. Our findings characterize the difference of two readers and their pros and cons, which can instruct the optimal selection of the two readers, and open up new research avenues to improve each reader. Our major findings are: 1) generative readers perform better when the input context is long, whereas extractive readers are better when the context is short; 2) extractive readers generalize better as compared to the generative ones under out-of-domain settings, in both single- and multi-task learning scenarios.   Our experiments also suggest that, although an encoder-only pre-trained language model (PrLM) is an intuitive choice for extractive readers, the encoder from  encoder-decoder PrLM is a strong alternative that performs competitively.",september,True,3.5851122450203374,17.16645301707684

Capturing low-frequency patterns, however, remains a challenging task. Here we consider a possible extension of the GPT-2 model with its improved capability of grasping the low-frequency patterns especially for task-specific dialogues. The extension consists of a semantic-oriented encoder and a GPT-2 decoder, the latter equipped with a knowledge-aware classification. The proposed encoder-decoder framework strengthens the GPT-2 in two task-specific aspects: One is in regard of a suitable way to select, on a semantic level, the crucial information of the dialogue context and the corresponding history knowledge from the documents; The other is in terms of the determination of the suitable time to generate a response with the knowledge from documents.

In this study, we crowdsource multiple-choice reading comprehension questions for passages taken from seven qualitatively distinct sources, analyzing what attributes of passages contribute to the difficulty and question types of the collected examples. We find that passage source, length, and readability measures do not significantly affect question difficulty. Among seven question types we manually annotate, questions that require numerical reasoning and logical reasoning are relatively difficult but their frequencies depend on the passage sources.

Instead, alt-text based captions gathered from the web is a far cheaper alternative to scale with the downside of being noisy. Recent modeling approaches to IC often fall short in terms of performance in leveraging these noisy datasets in favor of clean annotations. We address this problem by breaking down the task into two simpler, more controllable tasks -- skeleton prediction and skeleton-based caption generation. Specifically, we show that sub-selecting content words as skeletons helps in generating improved and denoised captions when leveraging rich yet noisy alt-text--based uncurated datasets. We also show that the predicted English skeletons can further cross-lingually be leveraged to generate non-English captions, and present experimental results covering caption generation in French, Italian, German, Spanish and Hindi. We also show that skeleton-based prediction allows for better control of certain caption properties, such as length, content, and gender expression, providing a handle to perform human-in-the-loop interpretable semi-automatic corrections.",september,True,-10.98854313059849,26.3220495888235

However, not much has been done on the front of investigating the effect of scaling properties of different inductive biases and model architectures. Do model architectures scale differently?

This paper conducts a systematic study of scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures such as Transformers, Switch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic convolutions, Performers, and recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive experiments, we show that (1) architecture is an indeed an important consideration when performing scaling and (2) the best performing model can fluctuate at different scales.

In DocRE, we observe that (1) a subset of the sentences in a document, noted as the evidence sentences, are often sufficient for predicting the relation between a specific entity pair; (2) these evidence sentences can be extracted in an effective and lightweight manner: by multi-task learning along with the RE model or by heuristic rules. In this paper, we propose a novel DocRE framework called Eider that automatically extracts and makes use of evidence. Eider enhances a DocRE model by combining the inference results from the evidence sentences and the original document through a blending layer. The performance can be further improved by jointly training an RE model with an evidence extraction model via multi-task learning. If human-annotated evidence is not available, we can use the evidence extracted by this joint model or by several heuristic rules. Extensive experiments show that Eider achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocRED, CDR, and GDA datasets. Remarkably, Eider outperforms the runner-up by 1.37/1.26 Ign F1/F1 on DocRED.

A potential solution to mitigate the data scarcity problem in low-resource setup is to leverage existing data in resource-rich language through translation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of code-mixed (Hinglish and Bengalish) to English machine translation. First, we synthetically develop HINMIX, a parallel corpus of Hinglish to English,  with ~5M sentence pairs. Subsequently, we propose JAMT, a robust perturbation based joint-training model that learns to handle noise in the real-world code-mixed text by parameter sharing across clean and noisy words.

To evaluate our converted treebanks, we perform lexical, sentential, and syntactic rule coverage analysis, as well as CCG parsing experiments.

F3lYBj1dpXX,Defending Textual Neural Networks against Black-Box Adversarial Attacks with Stochastic Multi-Expert Patcher,"Even though several methods have proposed to defend textual neural network (NN) models against black-box adversarial attacks, they often defend against a specific text perturbation strategy and/or require re-training the models from scratch. This leads to a lack of generalization in practice and redundant computation. In particular, the state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) require great time and computation resources. By borrowing an idea from software engineering, in order to address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm, SHIELD, which modifies and re-trains only the last layer of a textual NN, and thus it ""patches"" and ""transforms"" the NN into a stochastic weighted ensemble of multi-expert prediction heads. Considering that most of current black-box attacks rely on iterative search mechanisms to optimize their adversarial perturbations, SHIELD confuses the attackers by automatically utilizing different weighted ensembles of predictors depending on the input. In other words, SHIELD breaks a fundamental assumption of the attack, which is a victim NN model remains constant during an attack. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN, BERT, and RoBERTa-based textual NNs, once patched by SHIELD, exhibit a relative enhancement of 15%--70% in accuracy on average against 14 different black-box attacks, outperforming 6 defensive baselines across 3 public datasets.

To do so, we disrupt the lexical patterns found in naturally occurring stimuli in a novel fine-grained analysis of BERT's behavior.

To exploit these varying potentials for transfer learning, we propose a new hierarchical approach for few-shot and zero-shot generation. Our approach consists of a three-moduled jointly trained architecture: the first module independently lexicalises the distinct units of information in the input as sentence sub-units (e.g. phrases), the second module recurrently aggregates these sub-units to generate a unified intermediate output, while the third module subsequently post-edits it to generate a coherent and fluent final text. We perform extensive empirical analysis and ablation studies on few-shot and zero-shot settings across 4 datasets.

Instead of formulating the task of text-to-SQL as slot-filling, we propose to train sequence-to-sequence model with Schema-aware Denoising (SeaD), which consists of two denoising objectives that train model to either recover input or predict output from two novel erosion and shuffle noises. These model-agnostic denoising objectives act as the auxiliary tasks for structural data modeling during sequence-to-sequence generation. In addition, we propose a clause-sensitive execution guided (EG) decoding strategy to overcome the limitation of EG decoding for generative model. The experiments show that the proposed method improves the performance of sequence-to-sequence model in both schema linking and grammar correctness and establishes new state-of-the-art on WikiSQL benchmark.

We propose to pre-train the contextual parameters over split sentence pairs, which makes an efficient use of the available data for two reasons. Firstly, it increases the contextual training signal by breaking intra-sentential syntactic relations, and thus pushing the model to search the context for disambiguating clues more frequently. Secondly, it eases the retrieval of relevant context, since context segments become shorter.

The most crucial facet is arguably the novelty --- \emph{35 U.S. Code § 102} rejects more recent applications that have very similar prior arts. Such novelty evaluations differ the patent approval prediction from conventional document classification --- Successful patent applications may share similar writing patterns; however, too-similar newer applications would receive the opposite label, thus confusing standard document classifiers (e.g., BERT). To address this issue, we propose a novel framework \our that unifies the document classifier with handcrafted features, particularly time-dependent novelty scores. Specifically, we formulate the novelty scores by comparing each application with millions of prior arts using a hybrid of efficient filters and a neural bi-encoder. Moreover, we impose a new regularization term into the classification objective to enforce the monotonic change of approval prediction w.r.t. novelty scores. From extensive experiments on the large-scale USPTO dataset, we find that our time-dependent novelty features offer a boost on top of the document classifier. Also, our monotonic regularization, while shrinking the search space, can drive the optimizer to better local optima, yielding empirical performance gains. Ex-post analysis of prediction scores further confirms that the document classifier and handcrafted features capture distinct sets of learning information.

Current evaluation of an NMT system is usually built upon a heuristic decoding algorithm (e.g., beam search) and an evaluation metric assessing similarity between the translation and golden reference (e.g., BLEU). However, this system-level evaluation framework is prone to its evaluation over only one best hypothesis and search errors brought by heuristic decoding algorithms. To better understand NMT models, we propose a novel evaluation protocol, which defines model errors with hypothesis distribution. In particular, we first propose an exact top-$k$ decoding algorithm, which finds top-ranked hypotheses in the whole hypothesis space and avoids search errors. Then, we evaluate NMT model errors with the distance between hypothesis distribution with the ideal distribution, aiming for a comprehensive interpretation. We apply our evaluation on various NMT benchmarks and model architectures to provide an in-depth understanding of how NMT models work. We show that the state-of-the-art Transformer models are facing serious ranking errors and do not even outperform the random chance level. We further provide several interesting findings over data-augmentation techniques, dropouts, and deep/wide models.  Additionally, we analyze beam search's lucky biases and regularization terms.

Thus even strong models have difficulty posing attention to suitable personas so generating persona-irrelevant responses. Besides, the limited data scale and diversity further affect the performance. Thus, we start from data and propose to boost the model in data-level distillation and diversification (D$^3$). We first distill the original training samples into simplified persona-consistent ones, lowering the difficulty by removing redundant information in personas and dialogue history. Next in the diversification, we increase both the amount and diversity of distilled data to ease its insufficiency. A model will be trained via curricula, first on easier augmented samples and then on harder original ones. Experiments on the PersonaChat benchmark dataset illustrate the superiority of our method when packed with two strong base dialogue models (Transformer and GPT2) on various automatic metrics and human evaluation.

QbNdfN86b62,Continual Few-shot Relation Learning via Embedding Space Regularization and Data Augmentation,"Existing continual relation learning (CRL) methods rely on plenty of labeled training data for learning a new task, which can be hard to acquire in real scenario as getting large and representative labeled data is often expensive and time-consuming. It is therefore necessary for the model to learn novel relational patterns with very few labeled data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous task knowledge. In this paper, we formulate this challenging yet practical problem as continual few-shot relation learning (CFRL). Based on the finding that learning for new emerging few-shot tasks often results in feature distributions that are incompatible with previous tasks' learned distributions, we propose a novel method based on embedding space regularization and data augmentation. Our method generalizes to new few-shot tasks and avoids catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks by enforcing extra constraints on the relational embeddings and by adding extra relevant data in a self-supervised manner. With extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in CFRL task settings.",september,True,-15.8780451701954,-12.515844103020706

dTnMpK6jHiv,Measuring Factual Consistency of Abstractive Summaries,"Recent abstractive summarization systems fail to generate factual consistent -- faithful -- summaries, which heavily limits their practical application.  Commonly, these models tend to mix concepts from the source or hallucinate new content, completely ignoring the source. Addressing the faithfulness problem is perhaps the most critical challenge for current abstractive summarization systems. First automatic faithfulness metrics were proposed, but we argue that existing methods do not yet utilize all ""machinery"" that this field has to offer and introduce new approaches to assess factual correctness. We evaluate existing and our proposed methods by correlating them with human judgements and find that BERTScore works well. Next, we conduct a data analysis, which reveals common problems, ways to further improve the metrics and indicates that combining multiple metrics is promising.  Finally, we exploit faithfulness metrics in pre- and post-processing steps to decrease factual errors made by state-of-the-art summarization systems.

Metaphors help people understand the world by connecting new concepts and domains to more familiar ones. Large pre-trained language models (PLMs) are therefore assumed to encode metaphorical knowledge useful for NLP systems when processing language. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis for PLMs by probing the metaphoricity knowledge in their encodings, by measuring the cross-lingual and cross-dataset generalization of this knowledge, and by analyzing the application of this knowledge when generating metaphorical expressions. We present studies in multiple metaphoricity detection datasets and four languages (i.e., English, Spanish, Russian, and Farsi). Our extensive experiments suggest that contextual representations in PLMs do encode metaphoricity information, and mostly in their middle layers, and the knowledge is transferrable between languages and datasets in most cases. Finally, we show that PLMs face more challenges in generating metaphors, especially as their novelty increases.

7SQh5IvfeLq,Achieving Reliable Human Assessment of Open-Domain Dialogue Systems,"Evaluation of open-domain dialogue systems is highly challenging and development of better techniques is highlighted time and again as desperately needed. Despite substantial efforts to carry out reliable live evaluation of systems in recent competitions, annotations have been abandoned and reported as too unreliable to yield sensible results. This is a serious problem since automatic metrics are not known to provide a good indication of what may or may not be a high-quality conversation. Answering the distress call of competitions that have emphasized the urgent need for better evaluation techniques in dialogue, we present the successful development of human evaluation that is highly reliable while still remaining feasible and low cost. Self-replication experiments reveal almost perfectly repeatable results with a correlation of $r=0.969$. Furthermore, due to the lack of appropriate methods of statistical significance testing, the likelihood of potential improvements to systems occurring due to chance is rarely taken into account in dialogue evaluation, and the evaluation we propose facilitates application of standard tests. Since we have developed a highly reliable evaluation method, new insights into system performance can be revealed. We therefore include a comparison of state-of-the-art models (i) with and without personas, to measure the contribution of personas to conversation quality, as well as (ii) prescribed versus freely chosen topics.

In this work, we propose a new formulation -- accumulated prediction sensitivity, which measures fairness in machine learning models based on the model's prediction sensitivity to perturbations in input features. The metric attempts to quantify the extent to which a single prediction depends on a protected attribute, where the protected attribute encodes the membership status of an individual in a protected group.          We show that the metric can be theoretically linked with a specific notion of group fairness (statistical parity) and individual fairness. It also correlates well with humans' perception of fairness. We conduct experiments on two text classification datasets -- Jigsaw Toxicity, and Bias in Bios, and evaluate the correlations between metrics and manual annotations on whether the model produced a fair outcome. We observe that the proposed fairness metric based on prediction sensitivity is statistically significantly more correlated with human annotation than the existing counterfactual fairness metric.",september,True,27.994650923860824,5.340358356838365

UhWxRIIb0Bd,Decomposing Natural Logic Inferences in Neural NLI,"In the interest of interpreting neural NLI models and their reasoning strategies,  we carry out a systematic probing study which investigates whether these models capture the crucial semantic features central to natural logic: \emph{monotonicity} and \emph{concept inclusion}. Correctly identifying valid inferences in \emph{downward-monotone contexts} is a known stumbling block for NLI performance, subsuming linguistic phenomena such as negation scope and generalized quantifiers. To understand this difficulty, we emphasize monotonicity as a property of a \emph{context} and examine the extent to which  models capture monotonicity information in the contextual embeddings which are  intermediate to their decision making process. Drawing on the recent advancement of the probing paradigm, we compare the presence of monotonicity features across various models. We find that monotonicity information is notably weak in the representations of popular NLI models which achieve high scores on benchmarks,  and observe that previous improvements to these models based on fine-tuning strategies  have introduced stronger monotonicity features together with their improved performance on challenge sets.",october,True,-2.355950505493961,-6.345910788828091

AyY4k4BXLVL,D2U: Distance-to-Uniform Learning for Out-of-Scope Detection,"Supervised models trained for single-label classification tasks with cross-entropy loss are implicitly enforced to produce probability distributions that follow a discrete delta distribution in training. Model predictions in test time are expected to be similar to delta distributions given that the classifier determines the class of an input correctly. However, the shape of the predicted probability distribution becomes similar to the uniform distribution when the model cannot infer properly. We exploit this observation for detecting out-of-scope (OOS) utterances in conversational systems. Specifically, we propose a zero-shot post-processing step, called Distance-to-Uniform (D2U), exploiting not only the classification confidence score, but the shape of the entire output distribution. We also introduce a learning procedure that uses D2U for loss calculation in the supervised setup. We conduct experiments using six publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that the performance of out-of-scope detection is improved with our post-processing when there is no OOS training data, as well as with D2U learning procedure when OOS training data is available.",october,True,25.16565638266707,3.562073415063357

F0EkIHMrapS,Should We Trust This Summary? Bayesian Abstractive Summarization to The Rescue,"We explore the notion of uncertainty in the context of modern abstractive summarization models, using the tools of Bayesian Deep Learning. Our approach approximates Bayesian inference by first extending state-of-the-art summarization models with Monte Carlo dropout and then using them to perform multiple stochastic forward passes. Based on Bayesian inference we are able to effectively quantify uncertainty at prediction time. Having a reliable uncertainty measure, we can improve the experience of the end user by filtering out generated summaries of high uncertainty. Furthermore, uncertainty estimation could be used as a criterion for selecting samples for annotation, and can be paired nicely with active learning and human-in-the-loop approaches. Finally, Bayesian inference enables us to find a Bayesian summary which performs better than a deterministic one and is more robust to uncertainty. In practice, we show that our Variational Bayesian equivalents of BART and PEGASUS can outperform their deterministic counterparts on multiple benchmark datasets.",october,True,27.74778004617529,1.7495047821206942

Inspecting the Factuality of Hallucinations in Abstractive Summarization,"State-of-the-art abstractive summarization systems often generate hallucinations; i.e., content that is not directly inferable from the source text. Despite being assumed to be incorrect, we find that much hallucinated content is actually consistent with world knowledge, which we call factual hallucinations. Including these factual hallucinations in a summary can be beneficial because they provide useful background information.  In this work, we propose a novel detection approach that separates factual from non-factual hallucinations of entities.  Our method is based on an entity's prior and posterior probabilities according to pre-trained and finetuned masked language models, respectively. Empirical results suggest that our method vastly outperforms two baselines in both accuracy and F1 scores and has a strong correlation with human judgments on factuality classification tasks. Furthermore, we use our method as a reward signal to train a summarization system using an off-line reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that can significantly improve the factuality of generated summaries while maintaining the level of abstractiveness.

We probe the embedding layer of pretrained language models and show that models learn the internal character composition of whole word and subword tokens to a surprising extent, without ever seeing the characters coupled with the tokens. Our results show that the embedding layer of RoBERTa holds enough information to accurately spell up to a third of the vocabulary and reach high average character ngram overlap on all token types. We further test whether enriching subword models with additional character information can improve language modeling, and observe that this method has a near-identical learning curve as training without spelling-based enrichment. Overall, our results suggest that language modeling objectives incentivize the model to implicitly learn some notion of spelling, and that explicitly teaching the model how to spell does not enhance its performance on such tasks.",october,True,0.47096337706688074,-26.790853946777236

On Mitigating the Faithfulness-Abstractiveness Trade-off in Abstractive Summarization,"Despite recent progress in abstractive summarization, systems still suffer from faithfulness errors. While prior work has proposed models that improve faithfulness, it is unclear whether the improvement comes from an increased level of extractiveness of the model outputs as one naive way to improve faithfulness is to make summarization models more extractive. In this work, we present a framework for evaluating the effective faithfulness of summarization systems, by generating a faithfulness-abstractiveness trade-off curve that serves as a control at different operating points on the abstractiveness spectrum. We then show that the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) baseline as well as recently proposed methods for improving faithfulness, fail to consistently improve over the control at the same level of abstractiveness. Finally, we learn a selector to identify the most faithful and abstractive summary for a given document, and show that this system can attain higher faithfulness scores in human evaluations while being more abstractive than the baseline system on two datasets. Moreover, we show that our system is able to achieve a better faithfulness-abstractiveness trade-off than the control at the same level of abstractiveness.",october,True,16.868438067495756,26.590907363308805

Most previous studies tend to neglect relations between different subtasks and arguments and pay little attention to ontological frame knowledge defined in FrameNet. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-guided Incremental semantic parser with Double-graph (KID). We first introduce Frame Knowledge Graph (FKG), a heterogeneous graph containing both frames and FEs (Frame Elements) built on the frame knowledge so that we can derive knowledge-enhanced representations for frames and FEs. Besides, we propose Frame Semantic Graph (FSG) to represent frame semantic structures extracted from the text with graph structures. In this way, we can transform frame semantic parsing into an incremental graph construction problem to strengthen interactions between subtasks and relations between arguments.

Drawing upon studies on systematic generalization, we introduce and annotate questions according to three categories that measure different levels and kinds of generalization: training set overlap, compositional generalization (comp-gen), and novel entity generalization (novel-entity). When evaluating six popular parametric and non-parametric models, we find that for the established Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets, even the strongest model performance for comp-gen/novel-entity is 13.1/5.4% and 9.6/1.5% lower compared to that for the full test set – indicating the challenge posed by these types of questions. Furthermore, we show that whilst non-parametric models can handle questions containing novel entities, they struggle with those requiring compositional generalization. Through thorough analysis we find that key question difficulty factors are: cascading errors from the retrieval component, frequency of question pattern, and frequency of the entity.",october,True,2.0131488504369512,13.57134029544708

We identify two ways in which the definition of the system-level correlation is inconsistent with how metrics are used to evaluate systems in practice and propose changes to rectify this disconnect. First, we calculate the system score for an automatic metric using the full test set instead of the subset of summaries annotated by humans, which is currently standard practice. We demonstrate how this small change leads to more precise estimates of system-level correlations. Second, we propose to calculate correlations only on pairs of systems which are separated by differences in automatic scores that are commonly used to argue one system is of higher quality. This allows us to demonstrate that our best estimate of the correlation of ROUGE to human judgments is near 0 in realistic scenarios. Finally, the results from both analyses point to the need for future research to focus on developing more consistent and reliable human evaluations of summaries.",october,True,14.997801191192043,25.69549945788785

These features are integral to the interpretation of natural language, but also hard to annotate and identify with NLP methods.

We find that our approach achieves consistent improvements over different backbone summarization models.

In this work, we study the semantic change and relative frequency shift of slang words and compare this change with standard, nonslang words. To measure semantic change, we obtain contextualized representations of words, reduce their dimensionality and propose a metric to measure their average pairwise distances between two time periods. We apply causal discovery algorithms and causal inference to uncover the dynamics of language evolution and measure the effect that word type (slang/nonslang) has on both semantic change and frequency shift, as well as its relationship to absolute frequency and polysemy.

We present FarFetched, an entity-centric approach for reasoning based on news, where latent connections between events, actions or statements are discovered via their identified entity mentions and are represented with the help of a knowledge graph. We propose a way of selecting specific subsets from the accumulated wealth of information based on the user hypothesis and construct relevant premises relying on the semantic similarity between them. We leverage textual entailment recognition to provide a measurable way for assessing whether the user claim is plausible based on the selected evidence.

3YX-sCVoGl,GCPG: A General Framework for Controllable Paraphrase Generation,"Controllable paraphrase generation (CPG) incorporates various external conditions to obtain desirable paraphrases. However, existing works only highlight a special condition under two indispensable aspects of CPG (i.e., lexically and syntactically CPG) individually, lacking a unified circumstance to explore and analyze their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a general controllable paraphrase generation framework (GCPG), which represents both lexical and syntactical conditions as text sequences and uniformly processes them in an encoder-decoder paradigm. Under GCPG, we reconstruct commonly adopted lexical condition (i.e., Keywords) and syntactical conditions (i.e., Part-Of-Speech sequence, Constituent Tree, Masked Template and Sentential Exemplar) and study the combination of the two types. In particular, for Sentential Exemplar condition, we propose a novel exemplar construction method --- Syntax-Similarity based Exemplar (SSE). SSE retrieves a syntactically similar but lexically different sentence as the exemplar for each target sentence, avoiding exemplar-side words copying problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPG with SSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks. In addition, the combination of lexical and syntactical conditions shows the significant controllable ability of paraphrase generation, and these empirical results could provide novel insight to user-oriented paraphrasing.",october,True,33.07980108757424,11.354170213811358

This paper explores a deeper relationship between Transformer and numerical ODE methods. We first show that a residual block of layers in Transformer can be described as a higher-order solution to ODE. Inspired by this, we design a new architecture, {\it ODE Transformer}, which is analogous to the Runge-Kutta method that is well motivated in ODE. As a natural extension to Transformer, ODE Transformer is easy to implement and efficient to use. Experimental results on the large-scale machine translation, abstractive summarization, and grammar error correction tasks demonstrate the high genericity of ODE Transformer. It can gain large improvements in model performance over strong baselines (e.g., 30.77 and 44.11 BLEU scores on the WMT'14 English-German and English-French benchmarks) at a slight cost in inference efficiency.",october,True,19.68027921582945,-10.415287986205932
zBuFuBG3SN,Exploring the Impact of Negative Samples of Contrastive Learning:  A Case Study of Sentence Embedding,"Contrastive learning is emerging as a powerful self-supervised technique for extracting knowledge from unlabeled image and text data. This technique requires a balanced mixture of two ingredients: positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) samples. This is typically achieved by maintaining a queue of negative samples during training. Prior works in the area typically uses a fixed-length negative sample queue, but how the negative sample size affects the model performance remains unclear. The opaque impact of the number of negative samples on performance when employing contrastive learning aroused our in-depth exploration. This paper presents a momentum contrastive learning model with negative sample queue for sentence embedding, namely MoCoSE. We add the prediction layer to the online branch to make the model asymmetric and together with EMA update mechanism of the target branch to prevent model from collapsing. We define a maximum traceable distance metric, through which we learn to what extent the text contrastive learning benefits from the historical information of negative samples. Our experiments find that the best results are obtained when the maximum traceable distance is at a certain range, demonstrating that there is an optimal range of historical information for a negative sample queue.

Training these models requires ever more computational resources and most of the existing models are trained on English text only. It is exceedingly expensive to train these models in other languages. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a method – called WECHSEL – to transfer English models to new languages. We exchange the tokenizer of the English model to a tokenizer in the target language and initialize token embeddings such that they are close to semantically similar English tokens by utilizing multilingual static word embeddings covering English and the target language. We use WECHSEL to transfer GPT-2 and RoBERTa models to 4 other languages (French, German, Chinese and Swahili). WECHSEL improves over a previously proposed method for cross-lingual parameter transfer and outperforms models of comparable size trained from scratch in the target language with up to 64x less training effort.

Specifically, many prior works show that neural networks struggle with compositional generalization where training and testing distributions differ. However, most of these works are based on word-level synthetic data or a specific data split method to generate compositional biases. In this work, we propose a clause-level compositional example generation method, and we focus on text-to-SQL tasks. We start by splitting the sentences in the Spider text-to-SQL dataset into several sub-sentences, annotating each sub-sentence with its corresponding SQL clause, resulting in a new dataset, Spider-SS. Building upon Spider-SS, we further construct a new dataset named Spider-CG, by substituting and appending Spider-SS sub-sentences to test the ability of models to generalize compositionally. Experiments show that previous models suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on Spider-CG, even though every sub-sentence has been seen during training. To deal with this problem, we modify the RATSQL+GAP model to fit the segmented data of Spider-SS, and results show that this method can improve generalization performance.",october,True,6.926099035593632,7.076289841329212

Recent studies have applied graph neural network (GNN) techniques to capture the global word co-occurrence in a corpus. Most existing approaches require that all the nodes (training and test) in a graph are present during training, which are transductive and do not naturally generalise to unseen nodes. To make those models \textit{inductive}, previous works use extra resources, like pretrained word embedding. However, high-quality resource is not always available and can be hard to train. Under the extreme settings  with no extra resource and limited amount of training set, can we still learn an inductive graph-based text classification model? In this paper, we introduce a novel inductive graph-based text classification framework, namely InducT-GCN (InducTive Graph Convolutional Networks for Text classification).  Compared to transductive models that require test documents in training, we construct a graph based on the statistics of training documents only and represent document vectors with a weighted sum of word vectors. We then conduct one-directional GCN propagation during testing. Across five text classification benchmarks, our InducT-GCN outperformed state-of-the-art methods that are either transductive in nature or pre-trained additional resources. We also conducted scalability testing by gradually increasing the data size and revealed that our InducT-GCN can reduce the time and space complexity.",october,True,-0.4970967396814932,3.1632514425049747

Using a corpus of 709k resumes from IT firms, we train a series of models to classify the gender of the applicant, thereby measuring the extent of gendered information encoded in resumes. We also investigate whether it is possible to obfuscate gender from resumes by removing gender identifiers, removing gender sub-space in embedding models, etc. We find that there is a significant amount of gendered information in resumes even after obfuscation. A simple Tf-Idf model can learn to classify gender with AUROC=0.75, and more sophisticated transformer-based models achieve AUROC=0.8. We further find that gender predictive values have little correlation with gender direction of embeddings -- meaning that, what is predictive of gender is not necessarily ``gendered'' in the masculine/feminine sense.

In this paper, we introduce the ME-GCN (Multi-dimensional Edge-enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks) for semi-supervised text classification. A text graph for an entire corpus is firstly constructed to describe the undirected and multi-dimensional relationship of word-to-word, document-document, and word-to-document. The graph is initialised with corpus-trained multi-dimensional word and document node representation, and the relations are represented according to the distance of those words/documents nodes. Then, the generated graph is trained with ME-GCN, which considers the edge features as multi-stream signals, and each stream performs a separate graph convolutional operation. Our ME-GCN can integrate a rich source of graph edge information of the entire text corpus.

We then empirically study the correlation between sample efficiency and out-of-distribution robustness across three tasks, 23 total ID-OOD settings, and four broadly-applicable methods that change sample efficiency: (1) changing the pre-training data source; (2) using natural language prompts; (3) increasing model size; and (4) increasing the amount of pre-training data.

However, none of the prior work provides means to control the parts of a generated assertion.

Other studies have shown that language models can sometimes display the undesirable behavior of falling back into loops in which an utterance is repeated infinitely often. Here, we observe that the model's capacity to produce repetitions goes well beyond frequent or well-formed utterances, and generalizes to repeating completely arbitrary sequences of tokens. Construing this as a simple form of in-context learning, we hypothesize that these two phenomena are linked through shared processing steps.

The majority of previous work assumes that the relevant knowledge is given as input or retrieved from a static pool of knowledge. However, this assumption violates the real-world situation, where knowledge is continually updated and a chatbot has to \emph{dynamically} retrieve useful knowledge. In this paper, we propose a dialogue model that can access the vast and dynamic information from any search engine for response generation.

The query producer is trained without any human annotation of gold queries, making it easily transferable to other domains and search engines. More specifically, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to train the query producer, where rewards are obtained by comparing retrieved articles and gold responses.  Experiments show that our query producer can achieve R@$1$ and R@$5$ rates of 62.4\% and 74.8\% for retrieving gold knowledge, and the overall model generates better responses over a strong BART (Lewis et al., 2020) model and other typical baselines.",october,True,-11.535643809036896,13.374874714302265

In this work, we propose a robust and structurally aware table-text encoding architecture TableFormer, where tabular structural biases are incorporated completely through learnable attention biases. TableFormer is strictly invariant to row and column orders, and could understand tables better due to its tabular inductive biases. Our evaluations showed that TableFormer outperforms strong baselines in all settings on SQA, WTQ and TabFact table reasoning datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on SQA, especially when facing answer-invariant row and column order perturbations (6% improvement over the best baseline), because previous SOTA models' performance drops by 4% - 6% when facing such perturbations while TableFormer is not affected.

Across a 14-year longitudinal analysis, we demonstrate that the choice in definition of a political user has significant implications for behavioral analysis. Controlling for multiple factors, political users are more toxic on the platform and inter-party interactions are even more toxic---but not all political users behave this way.

L-j8a3P22cy,Ditch the Gold Standard: Re-evaluating Conversational Question Answering,"Conversational question answering (CQA) systems aim to provide natural-language answers to users in information-seeking conversations. Existing benchmarks compare CQA models on pre-collected human-human conversations, with ground-truth answers provided in conversational history. It remains unclear whether we can rely on this static evaluation for model development, or current systems can well generalize to real-world human-machine conversations. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of state-of-the-art CQA systems, where human evaluators converse with models and judge the correctness of their answers. We ﬁnd that the distribution of human-machine conversations drastically differs from that of human-human conversations, and evaluations using gold answers are inconsistent with human evaluations. We further investigate how to improve automatic evaluations and propose a question rewriting mechanism based on predicted history, which better correlates with human judgments. Finally, we analyze the impact of various modeling strategies. We hope that our ﬁndings can shed light on how to develop better CQA systems in the future.",october,True,-0.9252734823280889,20.2669630220647

Compared with the single-document summary, the input of multi-document summary is much longer and the logic is more complicated. This article proposes a hypothesis: taking the content of a document as the main body and the content of other documents as auxiliary information, a summary that combines all the information in the document collection can be generated. Based on this assumption, the multi-document summarization task can select one main document, and then combine the information of other documents for summary generation. This paper combines CopyTransformer and the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to design Multi-document summarization considering Main and Minor relationship model(3M). Empirical results on the Multi-News and DUC 2004 dataset show that the 3M brings substantial improvements over several strong baselines, manual evaluation shows that the generated abstract is fluent and can better express the content of the main document.

Existing approaches only learn class-specific semantic features and intermediate representations from source domains. This affects generalizability to unseen target domains, resulting in suboptimal performances. To this end, we present CONTaiNER, a novel contrastive learning technique that optimizes the inter-token distribution distance for Few-Shot NER. Instead of optimizing class-specific attributes, CONTaiNER optimizes a generalized objective of differentiating between token categories based on their Gaussian-distributed embeddings. This effectively alleviates overfitting issues originating from training domains. Our experiments in several traditional test domains (OntoNotes, CoNLL'03, WNUT '17, GUM) and a new large scale Few-Shot NER dataset (Few-NERD) demonstrate that on average, CONTaiNER outperforms previous methods by 3%-13% absolute F1 points while showing consistent performance trends, even in challenging scenarios where previous approaches could not achieve appreciable performance.

vt2mKMUI0vN,PPT: Pre-trained Prompt Tuning for Few-shot Learning,"Prompts for pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for adapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning performs comparably with conventional full-model tuning when downstream data are sufficient, whereas it is much worse under few-shot learning settings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning. We attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts. Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts into the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this Pre-trained Prompt Tuning framework ""PPT"". To ensure the generalization of PPT, we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that tuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform full-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings.

Specifically, the triplets should align well with downstream tasks by: (i) covering a wide range of domains (for open-domain applications), (ii) linking a question to its semantically relevant context with supporting evidence (for training the retriever), and (iii) identifying the correct answer in the context (for training the reader). Previous pretraining approaches generally fall short of one or more of these requirements. In this work, we automatically construct a large-scale corpus that meets all three criteria by consulting millions of references cited within Wikipedia.

However, existing hyperbolic networks are not completely hyperbolic, as they encode features in the hyperbolic space yet formalize most of their operations in the tangent space (a Euclidean subspace) at the origin of the hyperbolic model.

In this paper, we propose a fully hyperbolic framework to build hyperbolic networks based on the Lorentz model by adapting the Lorentz transformations (including boost and rotation) to formalize essential operations of neural networks. Moreover, we also prove that linear transformation in tangent spaces used by existing hyperbolic networks is a relaxation of the Lorentz rotation and does not include the boost, implicitly limiting the capabilities of existing hyperbolic networks. The experimental results on four NLP tasks show that our method has better performance for building both shallow and deep networks.

HiTab is a cross-domain dataset constructed from a wealth of statistical reports and Wikipedia pages, and has unique characteristics: (1) nearly all tables are hierarchical, and (2) QA pairs are not proposed by annotators from scratch, but are revised from real and meaningful sentences authored by analysts. (3) to reveal complex numerical reasoning in statistical reports, we provide fine-grained annotations of quantity and entity alignment.  Experiments suggest that this HiTab presents a strong challenge for existing baselines and a valuable benchmark for future research. Targeting hierarchical structure, we devise a hierarchy-aware logical form for symbolic reasoning over tables, which shows high effectiveness. Targeting table reasoning, we leverage entity and quantity alignment to explore partially supervised training in QA and conditional generation in NLG, and largely reduce spurious predictions in QA and produce better descriptions in NLG.

Current approaches either follow an end-to-end approach or condition the responses on similar emotion labels to generate empathetic responses. But empathy is a broad concept that refers to the cognitive and emotional reactions of an individual to the observed experiences of another and it is more complex than mere mimicry of emotion. Hence, it requires identifying complex human conversational strategies and dynamics in addition to generic emotions to control and interpret empathetic responding capabilities of chatbots. In this work, we make use of a taxonomy of eight empathetic response intents in addition to generic emotion categories in building a dialogue response generation model capable of generating empathetic responses in a controllable and interpretable manner. It consists of two modules: 1) a response emotion/intent prediction module; and 2) a response generation module. We propose several rule-based and neural approaches to predict the next response's emotion/intent and generate responses conditioned on these predicted emotions/intents. Automatic and human evaluation results emphasize the importance of the use of the taxonomy of empathetic response intents in producing more diverse and empathetically more appropriate responses than end-to-end models.",october,True,-20.137478672983505,17.23705351314495

For larger data, bias-only fine-tuning is competitive with other sparse fine-tuning methods. Besides their practical utility, these findings are relevant for the question of understanding the commonly-used process of finetuning: they support the hypothesis that finetuning is mainly about exposing knowledge induced by language-modeling training, rather than learning new task-specific linguistic knowledge.

Applying different feature importance methods to different predictive models yields lexica of varying quality. In this paper, we train diverse sequence classification models, including context-oblivious (SVMs, Feed-forward neural networks) and context-sensitive (RoBERTa, DistilBERT) models, and generate lexica based on different feature importance measurements, including attention, masking, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. We evaluate the generated lexica on their predictive performance on test sets within the same corpus domain and on their generalization to different but similar domains. We find that simple context-oblivious models produce lexica of similar accuracy within domain and of better accuracy across domains to those from complex context-sensitive models. Based on human evaluator ratings of these lexica, we also find that context-oblivious models generate similar lexica that are more aligned with human judgments.",october,True,6.645958093443185,-3.2270938192107352

In-domain parallel data is often very low resource and synthetic domain data generated via back-translation is frequently lower quality. To guide machine translation practitioners and characterize the effectiveness of domain adaptation methods under different data availability scenarios, we conduct an in-depth empirical exploration of monolingual and parallel data approaches to domain adaptation. We compare mixed domain fine-tuning, traditional back-translation, tagged back-translation, and shallow fusion with domain specific language models in isolation and combination.

In addition, existing large-scale PLMs are mainly trained from scratch individually, ignoring the availability of many existing well-trained PLMs. To this end, we explore the question that how can previously trained PLMs benefit training larger PLMs in future. Specifically, we introduce a novel pre-training framework named ""knowledge inheritance"" (KI), which combines both self-learning and teacher-guided learning to efficiently train larger PLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our KI framework.

A DEMix layer is a collection of expert feedforward networks, each specialized to a domain, that makes the LM modular: experts can be mixed, added, or removed after initial training. Extensive experiments with autoregressive transformer LMs (up to 1.3B parameters) show that DEMix layers reduce perplexity, increase training efficiency, and enable rapid adaptation. Mixing experts during inference, using a parameter-free weighted ensemble, enables better generalization to heterogeneous or unseen domains. Adding experts incorporates new domains without forgetting older ones, and removing experts restricts access to unwanted domains without additional training. Overall, these results demonstrate benefits of explicitly conditioning on textual domains during language modeling. ",october,True,-4.331955325365316,-31.05472346781132

KHBzMrQt6-W,"Old BERT, New Tricks: Artificial Language Learning for Pre-Trained Language Models","We extend the artificial language learning experimental paradigm from psycholinguistics and apply it to pre-trained language models -- specifically, BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). We treat a pretrained model as a subject in an artificial language learning experimental setting: in order to learn the relation between two linguistic properties A and B, we introduce a set of new, non-existent, linguistic items, give the model information about their variation along property A, then measure to what extent the model learns property B for these items as a result of training. We show this method at work for degree modifiers (expressions like *slightly*, *very*, *rather*, *extremely*) and test the hypothesis that the degree expressed by the modifier (low, medium or high degree) is related to its sensitivity to sentence polarity (whether it shows preference for affirmative or negative sentences or neither). Our experimental results are compatible with existing linguistic observations that relate degree semantics to polarity-sensitivity, including the main one: low degree semantics leads to positive polarity sensitivity (that is, to preference towards affirmative contexts).  The method can be used in linguistic theory to elaborate on hypotheses and interpret experimental results, as well as for more insightful evaluation of linguistic representations in language models.",october,True,3.221243218397153,-18.084091445068882

In this paper, we present an approach to knowledge-aware image captioning, with a specific focus on the temporal domain. We propose a way to identify relevant information in external data sources, such as geographic databases and common knowledge bases, and then encode it in a way that is most useful for the captioning network. We develop an end-to-end caption generation system that incorporates external knowledge into the captioning process at several stages. The system is trained and tested on our novel temporal knowledge-aware captioning dataset, achieving significant improvements over multiple baselines across standardly used metrics. We demonstrate that our approach is effective for generating highly contextualized captions with both relevant and accurate temporal facts.",november,True,-10.00327856493245,26.447287687830688

No research involving Indigenous language data can be considered ethical without first acknowledging that Indigenous languages are not merely very low resource languages. The toxic legacy of colonialism permeates every aspect of interaction between Indigenous communities and outside academic researchers.

However, since the records are usually messy, this graph is very sparse, which affects the quality of the learned representation and hinders further analysis. To address this specific issue, we propose to enrich the graph with additional nodes that improve the quality of job title representation. Specifically, we construct Job-Transition-Tag Graph, a heterogeneous graph containing two types of nodes, i.e., job titles and tags (i.e., words related to job responsibilities or functions).

-MoY6seu_x,Bootstrapping Text Anonymization Models with Distant Supervision,"We propose a novel method to bootstrap text anonymization models based on distant supervision.  Instead of requiring manually labeled training data, the approach relies on a knowledge graph expressing the background information assumed to be publicly available about various individuals. This knowledge graph is employed to automatically annotate text documents including personal data about a subset of those individuals. More precisely, the method determines which text spans ought to be masked in order to guarantee $k$-anonymity, assuming an adversary with access to both the text documents and the background information expressed in the knowledge graph. The resulting collection of labeled documents is then used as training data to fine-tune a pre-trained language model for text anonymization. We illustrate this approach using a knowledge graph extracted from Wikidata and short biographical texts from Wikipedia. Evaluation results with a BERT-based model and a manually annotated collection of 553 summaries showcase the potential of the approach, but also unveil a number of issues that may arise the knowledge graph is noisy or incomplete.  The results also illustrate that, contrary to most sequence labeling problems, the text anonymization task may admit several alternative solutions.

4SoRR0ov-bn,So Different Yet So Alike! Constrained Unsupervised Text Style Transfer,"Automatic transfer of text between domains has become popular in recent times. One of its aims is to preserve the semantic content while adapting to the target domain. However, it does not explicitly maintain other attributes between the source and translated text: e.g., text length and descriptiveness. Maintaining constraints in transfer has several downstream applications, including data augmentation and debiasing.  We introduce a method for such constrained unsupervised text style transfer by introducing two complementary losses to the generative adversarial network (GAN) family of models. Unlike the competing losses used in GANs, we introduce cooperative losses where the discriminator and the generator cooperate and reduce the same loss. The first is a contrastive loss and the second is a classification loss --- aiming to regularize the latent space further and bring similar sentences closer together. We demonstrate that such training retains lexical, syntactic and domain-specific constraints between domains for multiple benchmark datasets, including ones where more than one attribute change.  We show that the complementary cooperative losses improve text quality, according to both automated and human evaluation measures.",november,True,19.851303513020657,2.772072717908888

We evaluate the method on English newswire data and compare it against supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised methods. We find that the performance of the method is lower than these baselines, because it tends to generate more and longer spans, and in some cases it relies only on capitalization. In other cases, it generates spans that are valid but differ from the benchmark.

To introduce consistent constraints, we propose a general method for introducing consistency objectives, as well as other prior knowledge, into existing neural models.

Furthermore, the bi-direction attention capsule-based network (BACN) is proposed to capture dynamic inter-modality context via the novel bi-direction dynamic routing mechanism. Specifically, BACN firstly highlights the static and low-level inter-modality context based on top-down attention. Then, the static multimodal context is transmitted to dynamic routing procedure, naturally allowing us to investigate dynamic and high-level inter-modality context. This indeed unleash the expressive power and provides the superior capability to bridge the modality gap among all the modalities.

In order to measure to what extent current vision-and-language models master this ability, we devise a new multimodal challenge, Image Retrieval from Contextual Descriptions (ImageCoDe). In particular, models are tasked with retrieving the correct image from a set of 10 minimally contrastive candidates based on a contextual description. As such, each description contains only the details that help distinguish between images. Because of this, descriptions tend to be complex in terms of syntax and discourse and require drawing pragmatic inferences.  Images are sourced from both static pictures and video frames. We benchmark several state-of-the-art models, including both cross-encoders such as ViLBERT and bi-encoders such as CLIP, on ImageCoDe. Our results reveal that these models dramatically lag behind human performance: the best variant achieves an accuracy of 20.9 on video frames and 59.4 on static pictures, compared with 90.8 in humans. Furthermore, we experiment with new model variants that are better equipped to incorporate visual and temporal context into their representations, which achieve modest gains.

The factual robustness analysis on a wide range of current systems shows its good consistency with human judgments on faithfulness.Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve a model's faithfulness by enhancing its factual robustness.Specifically, we propose a novel training strategy, namely FRSUM, which teaches the model to defend against both explicit adversarial samples and implicit factual adversarial perturbations.Extensive automatic and human evaluation results show that FRSUM consistently improves the faithfulness of various Seq2Seq models, such as T5, BART and PEGASUS, and reduces up to 41\% target errors in summaries.",november,True,17.129554425889125,26.434234038165705

DX8E-03pBrV,Listen to Both Sides and be Enlightened! -- Hierarchical Modality Fusion Network for  Entity and Relation Extraction,"Multimodal named entity recognition and relation extraction (MNER and MRE) is a fundamental and crucial branch in multimodal learning.  However, existing approaches for MNER and MRE mainly suffer from 1)  error sensitivity when images contain irrelevant concepts not mentioned in texts; and 2) large modality gap between image and text features, especially hierarchical visual features.  To deal with these issues, we propose a novel Hierarchical Modality fusion NeTwork (HMNeT) for visual-enhanced entity and relation extraction, aim to reduce the modality gap and achieve more effective and robust performance. Specifically, we innovatively leverage hierarchical pyramidal visual features to conduct multi-layer internal integration in Transformer. We further present a dynamic gated aggregation strategy to decide modality integration according to different images. Extensive  experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and achieve  state-of-the-art performance.",november,True,-26.176213850003595,-0.8163569954890242

USuyAFWEuY,Event-Event Relation Extraction using Probabilistic Box Embedding,"To understand a story with multiple events, it is important to capture the proper relations across these events. However, existing event relation extraction (ERE) framework regards it as a multi-class classification task and do not guarantee any coherence between different relation types, such as anti-symmetry. If a phone line ""died"" after ""storm"", then it is obvious that the ""storm"" happened before the ""died"". Current framework of event relation extraction do not guarantee this coherence and thus enforces it via constraint loss function (Wang et al., 2020). In this work, we propose to modify the underlying ERE model to guarantee coherence by representing each event as a box representation (BERE) without applying explicit constraints. From our experiments, BERE also shows stronger conjunctive constraint satisfaction while performing on par or better in F1 compared to previous models with constraint injection.",november,True,-14.340202369363494,32.09272577155325

Previous results showed that generative models outperform discriminative models on several English ABSA datasets. Here, we rigorously contrast discriminative and generative models in several settings. We compare both model types in cross-lingual, cross-domain, and cross- lingual and domain, to understand generalizability in settings other than mono-lingual English in-domain.

To expand possibilities of using NLP technology in these under-represented languages, we systematically study strategies that relax the reliance on conventional language resources through the use of bilingual lexicons, an alternative resource with much better language coverage. We analyze different strategies to synthesize textual or labeled data using lexicons, and how this data can be combined with monolingual or parallel text when available. For 19 under-represented languages across 3 tasks, our methods lead to consistent improvements of up to 5 and 15 points with and without extra monolingual text respectively.

However, it is utopian that the word order strictly obeys the grammar rules in a language, especially in oral. To address the mismatch between SimulNMT expecting strict word order and free word order in real scenario, we propose a bidirectional modeling. In detail, we train another backward model where the input sentence is from right-to-left and keep the target sentence from left-to-right. Then we join this backward model into the standard forward SimulNMT model during decoding. This strategy enhances the robustness of SimulNMT and empowers the model to be more adaptable for the inconstant word ordering phenomenon.

However, we find that different faithfulness metrics show conflicting preferences when comparing different interpretations. Motivated by this observation, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and comparative study of the widely adopted faithfulness metrics. In particular, we introduce two assessment dimensions, namely diagnosticity and complexity. Diagnosticity refers to the degree to which the faithfulness metric favors relatively faithful interpretations over randomly generated ones, and complexity is measured by the average number of model forward passes.

To address this challenge, some recent efforts of cross-lingual MRC employ machine translation to transfer knowledge from English to other languages, through either explicit alignment or implicit attention. For effective knowledge transition, it is beneficial to leverage both semantic and syntactic information. However, the existing methods fail to explicitly incorporate syntax information in model learning. Consequently, the models are not robust to errors in alignment and noises in attention. In this work, we propose a novel approach, named GraFusionMRC, which jointly models the cross-lingual alignment information and the mono-lingual syntax information using a graph. We develop a series of algorithms including graph construction, learning, and pre-training. The experiments on two benchmark datasets for cross-lingual MRC show that our approach outperforms all strong baselines, which verifies the effectiveness of syntax information for cross-lingual MRC.

However, recent works find that PLMs are short in acquiring knowledge from the unstructured text, by asking models to do cloze-style tests.  To understand the internal behavior of PLMs in retrieving knowledge, we firstly define knowledge-baring tokens and knowledge-free tokens for unstructured text and manually label on some samples. Then, we find that PLMs are more likely to predict incorrectly on K-B tokens and attend less attention to those tokens inside the self-attention module.  Based on these observations, we develop two solutions to help the model learn more knowledge from the unstructured text in a fully self-supervised manner.

We show that the extent of encoded linguistic knowledge depends on the number of fine-tuning samples, specifically the number of iterations for which the model is updated. The analysis also reveals that larger training data mainly affects higher layers, and that the extent of this change is a factor of the number of iterations in fine-tuning rather than the diversity of the training samples.

A common practice is first to learn a NER model in a rich-resource general domain and then adapt the model to specific domains. Due to the mismatch problem between entity types across domains, the wide knowledge in the general domain can not effectively transfer to the target domain NER model. To this end, we model the label relationship as a probability distribution and construct label graphs in both source and target label spaces. To enhance the contextual representation with label structures, we fuse the label graph into the word embedding output by BERT. By representing label relationships as graphs, we formulate cross-domain NER as a graph matching problem. Furthermore, the proposed method has good applicability with pre-training methods and is potentially capable of other cross-domain prediction tasks.

VbtRUvpzht,VQN: Variable Quantization Noise for Neural Network Compression,"Quantization refers to a set of methods that compress a neural network by representing its parameters with fewer bits. However, applying quantization to a neural network after training often leads to severe performance regressions. Quantization Aware Training (QAT) addresses this problem by applying simulated training-time quantization for the model to learn robustness to inference-time quantization. One key drawback of this approach is that quantization functions induce biased gradient flow through the network during backpropagation, thus preventing the network from best-fitting to the learning task. Fan et al. addressed this issue by proposing Quant-Noise, in which simulated quantization is applied to a fixed proportion, called the quantization noise rate, of parameters during training. Our study, Variable Quantization Noise (VQN), builds upon their technique by exploring a variable quantization noise rate instead of a fixed one. We craft three candidate functions to vary noise rate during training and evaluate the variants with 3 datasets and 3 quantization schemes for each dataset. First, we report negative results on our hand-crafted candidate functions. Second, we observe somewhat positive results on a method, originally intended as an ablation study, of randomly varying the noise rate during training. This method outperforms Quant-Noise on two out of three quantization schemes for all three tested datasets. Moreover, on two of the datasets, this method at 4x compression matches or exceeds performance of even the uncompressed model.

QXlUtiZIARH,Improving Controllable Text Generation with Position-Aware Weighted Decoding,"Weighted decoding methods composed of the pretrained language model (LM) and the controller have achieved promising results for controllable text generation. However, these models often suffer from a control strength/fluency trade-off problem as higher control strength is more likely to generate incoherent and repetitive text. In this paper, we illustrate this trade-off is arisen by the controller imposing the target attribute on the LM at improper positions. And we propose a novel framework based on existing weighted decoding methods called CAT-PAW, which introduces a lightweight regulator to adjust bias signals from the controller at different decoding positions. Experiments on positive sentiment control, topic control, and language detoxification show the effectiveness of our CAT-PAW upon 4 SOTA models.",november,True,1.3465795933232545,-20.02324754078016
qFV4ATfOE2C,Can Pre-trained Models Really Generate Single-Step Textual Entailment?,"We investigate the task of generating textual entailment (GTE). Different from prior works on recognizing textual entailment, also known as NLI, GTE requires the models with deeper reasoning capabilities - generating entailment from premises rather than making prediction on given premises and the entailment. We argue that existing adapted datasets are limited and inadequate to train and evaluate human-like reasoning in the GTE. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale benchmark, named \mydataset, targeted for learning and evaluating models' capabilities towards RTE. \mydataset consists of 15k instances with each containing a pair of premise statements and a human-annotated entailment. It is constructed by first retrieving instances from a knowledge base, and then augmenting each instance with several complementary instances by 7 manually crafted  transformations. We demonstrate that even extensively fine-tuned pre-trained models perform poorly on \mydataset. The best generator models can only generate valid textual entailment 59.1\% of times. Further, to motivate future advances, we provide detailed analysis to show significant gaps between baselines and human performance.",november,True,-4.537850703445311,-8.774089358486615

2Po_v-AG9u,There’s a Time and Place for Reasoning Beyond the Image,"Images are often more significant than only the pixels to human eyes, as we can infer, associate, and reason with contextual information from other sources to establish a more complete picture. For example, in Figure 1, we can find a way to identify the news articles related to the picture through segment-wise understandings on the signs, the buildings, the crowds, and more. This tells us the time when and the location where the image is taken, which will help us in subsequent tasks, such as evidence retrieval for criminal activities, automatic storyline construction, and upper-stream processing such as image clustering.   In this work, we formulate this problem and introduce TARA: a dataset with 16k images with their associated news, time and location automatically extracted from New York Times (NYT), and an additional 61k examples as distant supervision from WIT. On top of the extractions, we present a crowdsourced subset in which images are believed to be feasible to find their spatio-temporal information for evaluation purpose. We show that there exists a $70\%$ gap between a state-of-the-art joint model and human performance, which is slightly filled by our proposed model that uses segment-wise reasoning, motivating higher-level vision-language joint models that can conduct open-ended reasoning with world knowledge.",november,True,-10.148915491131477,23.910594354314473

While each story sentence should describe a corresponding image, a coherent story also needs to be consistent and relate to both future and past images. Current approaches encode images independently, disregarding relations between images.  Our approach learns to encode images with different interactions based on the story position (i.e., past image or future image). To this end,  we develop a novel message-passing-like algorithm for ordered image attention (OIA) that collects interactions across all the images in the sequence. Finally, to generate the story's sentences, a second attention mechanism picks the important image attention vectors with an Image-Sentence Attention (ISA). The obtained results improve the METEOR score on the VIST dataset by 1%. Furthermore, a thorough human study confirms improvements and demonstrates that order-based Interactions significantly improve coherency (64.20% vs. 28.70%).

du9X3J0losl,Logic Traps in Evaluating Attribution Scores,"Modern deep learning models are notoriously opaque, which has motivated the development of methods for interpreting how deep models predict. This goal is usually approached with attribution method, which assesses the influence of features on model predictions.  As an explanation method, the evaluation criteria of attribution methods is how accurately it reflects the actual reasoning process of the model (faithfulness). Meanwhile, since the reasoning process of deep models is inaccessible, researchers design various evaluation methods to demonstrate their arguments. However, some crucial logic traps in these evaluation methods are ignored in most works, causing inaccurate evaluation and unfair comparison. This paper systematically reviews existing methods for evaluating attribution scores and summarizes the logic traps in these methods. We further conduct experiments to demonstrate the existence of each logic trap. Through both theoretical and experimental analysis, we hope to increase attention on the inaccurate evaluation of attribution scores.  Moreover, with this paper, we suggest stopping focusing on improving performance under unreliable evaluation systems and starting efforts on reducing the impact of proposed logic traps.",november,True,0.5016745429316087,-3.9477350097402533

cL4tgY1ZxS,Simple yet Powerful: An Overlooked Architecture for Nested Named Entity Recognition,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to identify text spans belonging to predefined categories. Traditional NER research ignores nested entities, which are entities contained in other entity mentions. Although several methods have been proposed to address this case, most of them rely on complex task-specific structures and ignore potentially useful baselines for the task. We argue that this creates an overly optimistic impression of their performance. This paper revisits the Multiple LSTM-CRF (MLC) model, a simple, overlooked, yet powerful approach based on training independent sequence labeling models for each entity type. Extensive experiments with three nested NER corpora show that, regardless of the simplicity of this model, its performance is better or at least as well as more sophisticated methods. Furthermore, we show that the MLC architecture achieves state-of-the-art results in the Chilean Waiting List corpus by including pre-trained language models. In addition, we propose new task-specific metrics that adequately measure the ability of models to detect nestings. The results show that standard NER metrics do not measure well the ability of a model to detect nested entities, while our task-specific metrics provide new evidence on how existing approaches handle the task.",november,True,-30.034884510693416,-6.167519769473413

During lessons, teachers can use comprehension questions to increase engagement, test reading skills, and improve retention. Historically such questions were written by skilled teachers, but recently language models have been used to generate comprehension questions. However, many existing Question Generation (QG) systems focus on generating extractive questions from the text, and have no way to control the type of the generated question. In this paper, we study QG for reading comprehension where inferential questions are critical and extractive techniques cannot be used. We propose a two-step model (HTA-WTA) that takes advantage of previous datasets, and can generate questions for a specific targeted comprehension skill. We propose a new reading comprehension dataset that contains questions annotated with story-based reading comprehension skills (SBRCS), allowing for a more complete reader assessment. Across several experiments, our results show that HTA-WTA outperforms multiple strong baselines on this new dataset.

jO0vmMUrlMB,Exploring Human-judged and Automatically-induced Correction Difficulty for Grammatical Error Correction,"While grammatical error correction (GEC) has improved in its correction performance, one of the key challenges in GEC research still remains in evaluation. Specifically, all errors are equally treated in the conventional performance measures despite the fact that some errors are more difficult to correct than others. Ideally, difficult errors should be regarded to be more important than easy ones in evaluation. This leads to the following ultimate research question --- Can even human experts estimate correction difficulty well? In this paper, we explore questions about correction difficulty centering on this research question. For this purpose, we first introduce a method for estimating agreement rates in correction difficulty judgements based on pairwise comparison. With the annotation of 2,025 instances using this method, we show that human experts exhibit a moderate agreement rate of 66.39\% (Cohen's-$\kappa$: 0.42) in judging correction difficulty. We also show that the agreement between this human-based difficulty and an automatically induced difficulty is comparable (64.50\% and $\kappa=0.35$ on average). We further look into the annotation results to reveal the insights of the human-judged and machine-judged correction difficulties, reporting on following three findings: (i) where the human-judged and machine-judged difficulties are strong and weak; (ii) based on (i), correction difficulty can be GEC-algorithm- and training-corpus-dependent; (iii) human-judged and machine-judged correction difficulties complement each other.",november,True,-19.164806979650603,-29.21557811543872

Despite the great success in sentence-level event extraction, events are more naturally presented in the form of documents, with event arguments scattering in multiple sentences.

To facilitate this, we release a well-curated biomedical knowledge probing benchmark, MedLAMA, constructed based on the Unified Medical Language System~(UMLS) Metathesaurus. We test a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art PLMs and probing approaches on our benchmark, reaching at most $3\%$ of acc@10. While highlighting various sources of domain-specific challenges that amount to this underwhelming performance, we illustrate that the underlying PLMs have a higher potential for probing tasks. To achieve this, we propose Contrastive-Probe, a novel self-supervised contrastive probing approach, that adjusts the underlying PLMs without using any probing data. While Contrastive-Probe pushes the acc@10 to $28\%$, the performance gap still remains notable.

Deep learning offers a solution for several essential obstacles to deploying AL in practice but introduces many others. One of such problems is the excessive computational resources required to train an acquisition model and estimate its uncertainty on instances in the unlabeled pool. We propose two techniques that tackle this issue for text classification and tagging tasks, offering a substantial reduction of AL iteration duration and the computational overhead introduced by deep acquisition models in AL. We also demonstrate that our algorithm that leverages pseudolabeling and distilled models overcomes one of the essential obstacles revealed previously in the literature. Namely, it was shown that due to differences between an acquisition model used to select instances during AL and a successor model trained on the labeled data, the benefits of AL can diminish. We show that our algorithm, despite using a smaller and faster acquisition model, is capable of training a more expressive successor model with higher performance.",november,True,-13.303886354385279,-41.444696260151815

However, the indexing and retrieving of large-scale corpora bring considerable computational cost. Surprisingly, we found that REtrieving from the traINing datA (REINA) only can lead to significant gains on multiple NLG and NLU tasks. We retrieve the labeled training instances most similar to the input text and then concatenate them with the input to feed into the model to generate the output. Experimental results show that this simple method can achieve significantly better performance on a variety of NLU and NLG tasks, including summarization, machine translation, language modeling, and question answering tasks.

A key contribution is the combination of semi-automatic resource building for extraction of domain-dependent concern types (with 2-4 hours of human labor per domain) and an entirely automatic procedure for extraction of domain-independent moral dimensions and endorsement values.  Prudent (automatic) selection of terms from propositional structures for lexical expansion (via semantic similarity) produces new moral dimension lexicons at three levels of granularity beyond a strong baseline lexicon. We develop a ground truth (GT) based on expert annotators and compare our concern detection output to GT, to yield 231% improvement in recall over baseline, with only a 10% loss in precision. F1 yields 66% improvement over baseline and 97.8% of human performance. Moreover, our lexically based approach yields large savings in terms of human labor and costly model building.

VAIDA facilitates sample correction by providing realtime visual feedback and recommendations to improve sample quality. Our approach is domain, model, task, and metric agnostic, and constitutes a paradigm shift for robust, validated, and dynamic benchmark creation via human-and-metric-in-the-loop workflows. We evaluate via expert review and a user study with NASA TLX. We find that VAIDA decreases effort, frustration, mental, and temporal demands of crowdworkers and analysts, simultaneously increasing the performance of both user groups with a 45.8% decrease in the level of artifacts in created samples. As a by product of our user study, we observe that created samples are adversarial across models, leading to decreases of 31.3% (BERT), 22.5% (RoBERTa), 14.98% (GPT-3 fewshot) in performance.",november,True,1.7083217688672154,-10.23318650455305

However, previous works (i) distill partial transformer layers of the teacher model, which ignore the importance of bottom base information, or (ii) neglect the difficulty differences of knowledge from deep to shallow, which corresponds to different level information of teacher model. We introduce a deep-to-bottom weights decay review mechanism to knowledge distillation, which fuses teacher-side information taking each layer’s difficulty level into consideration.

They treat nested entities as partially-observed constituency trees and propose the masked inside algorithm for partial marginalization. However, their method cannot leverage entity heads, which have been shown useful in entity mention detection and entity typing. In this work, we resort to more expressive structures, lexicalized constituency trees in which constituents are annotated by headwords, to model nested entities. We leverage the Eisner-Satta algorithm to perform partial marginalization and inference efficiently. In addition, we propose to use (1) a two-stage strategy (2) a head regularization loss and (3) a head-aware labeling loss in order to enhance the performance.

Existing phrase representation learning methods either simply combine unigram representations in a context-free manner or rely on extensive annotations to learn context-aware knowledge. In this paper,  we propose UCTopic,  a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework for context-aware phrase representations and topic mining. UCTopic is pretrained in a large scale to distinguish if the contexts of two phrase mentions have the same semantics. The key to the pretraining is positive pair construction from our phrase-oriented assumptions.   However,  we find traditional in-batch negatives cause performance decay when finetuning on a  dataset with small topic numbers. Hence, we propose cluster-assisted contrastive learning  (CCL)  which largely reduces noisy negatives by selecting negatives from clusters and further improves phrase representations for topics accordingly.

Experiments are performed and analysed for three language pairs, combining English with three target languages from very different language families, Hindi, Dutch, and Russian. Although the contextualised approach is not able to outperform the SOTA VecMap method, we find that it is easily adaptable to newer transformer models and can compete with the MUSE approach. An error analysis reveals interesting trends accross languages and shows how the method could be further improved by building on the basic hypothesis that transformer embeddings can indeed be decomposed into a static anchor and a dynamic context component.

A promising way to solve this task is a two-stage pipeline, where the first stage retrieves a set of candidates, and the second stage uses a neural network to rank the retrieved candidates. There are three standard methods to train neural rankers, Binary Cross-Entropy loss, Mean Square Error loss, and Hinge loss. While all these training strategies assign the same label for all the negative candidates, we argue that negativeness is not binary but exists as a spectrum, i.e., some candidates may be more negative than the others, and thus should be treated differently. We present SCONER---scoring negative candidates before training neural ranker---a model trained to differentiate negative candidates. Our approach includes 1) semantic textual similarity-based scoring together with data augmentation for score generation of negative candidates, and 2) a neural ranker trained on data using generated scores as labels. Together, we systematically compare three standard training methods and our proposed method on a range of ReQA datasets under multiple settings (i.e., single-domain and multi-domain). Our finding suggests that using more negative candidates to train neural rankers are better than less in both single- and multi-domain settings, where SCONER is the best in the single-domain settings and Hinge loss is the best in multi-domain settings.

It alleviates the problems caused by the shortage in low-resource language training data.

Our experiments on English, Finnish and Turkish show that humans tend to balance creativity and consistency, while algorithms tend to be either strongly biased or inconsistent. To imitate humans better, algorithms need to produce subword segments of moderately uneven length, which can be achieved by combining complementary strategies.

In this work, we propose a new method, progressive down-sampling (PDS), for encoding the context sufficiently before each condensation. Also, we develop a representation fusion method to alleviate information loss by combining the multi-scale representations. Experimental results on the 960h LibriSpeech automatic speech recognition task show that, for a strong Conformer-based system, our method down-samples the input speech features to 1/32 of the initial length, while yielding an improvement of 0.47 WER with a speedup of 1.42$\times$.

However, recent works lack the capability of modeling multi-turn dynamics within a dialog where the contexts are mostly adopted for updating dialog states instead of capturing overall intent semantic flows in spoken language understanding (SLU). Moreover, external knowledge related to dialogs may be beneficial in exploring deep semantic information across dialog turns, which many works only considered for end-to-end response generation. In this paper, we propose to equip a BERT-based joint framework with a context attention module and a knowledge attention module to introduce knowledge attention with contexts between two SLU tasks. We propose three attention mechanisms to induce both global and local attention on knowledge triples.

KWL_ElhUejN,Contextual Representation Learning beyond Masked Language Modeling,"Currently, masked language modeling (e.g., BERT) is the prime choice to learn contextualized representations. Due to the pervasiveness, it naturally raises an interesting question: how do masked language models (MLMs) learn contextual representations?  In this work, we analyze the learning dynamics of MLMs and find that it adopts sampled embeddings as anchors to estimate and inject contextual semantics to representations, which limits the efficiency and effectiveness of MLMs. To address these problems, we propose TACO, a simple yet effective representation learning approach to directly model global semantics. To be specific, TACO extracts and aligns contextual semantics hidden in contextualized representations to encourage models to attend global semantics when generating contextualized representations. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that TACO achieves up to 5x speedup and up to 1.2 points average improvement over MLM.",november,True,0.8567447541301798,-29.45968241545807

Our analyses reveal the emotional toll caused by COVID-19, and changes of the social narrative and associated emotions over time. Motivated by the time-sensitive nature of crises and the cost of large-scale annotation efforts, we examine how well large pre-trained language models generalize across domains and timeline in the task of perceived emotion prediction in the context of COVID-19.

u7APnx5qszb,Structure Representation Learning by Jointly Learning to Pool and Represent,"Structure representation learning is a task to provide an overall representation for a given structure (e.g., sequential text, non-sequential graph). This representation characterizes the property of that structure. Previous methods decompose the task into an element representation learning phase and a pooling phase to aggregate element representations. Their pooling phase only considers the final representation of each element without considering the relationship between these elements that are used only to construct representations of elements. In this paper, we conjecture that classification performance suffers from the lack of relation exploitation while pooling and propose the Self-Attention Pooling to dynamically provide centrality scores for pooling based on the self-attention scores from the element representation learning.  Simply applying Self-Attention Pooling improves model performance on $3$ sentence classification tasks ({$\boldsymbol{\uparrow 2.9}$}) and $5$ graph classification tasks ({$\boldsymbol{\uparrow 2.1}$}) on average.

nXEiMRv7Zyq,Gradient Sparsification For \emph{Masked Fine-Tuning} of Transformers,"Fine-tuning masked language models is widely adopted for transfer learning to downstream tasks and can be achieved by (1) freezing gradients of the pretrained network or only updating gradients of a newly added classification layer or (2) performing gradient updates on all parameters. Gradual unfreezing trades off between the two by gradually unfreezing gradients of whole layers during training. We propose to extend this to {\em stochastic gradient masking} to regularize pretrained language models for improved fine-tuning performance. We introduce \emph{GradDrop} and variants thereof, a class of gradient sparsification methods that mask gradients prior to gradient descent. Unlike gradual unfreezing which is non-sparse and deterministic, GradDrop is sparse and stochastic. Experiments on the multilingual XGLUE benchmark with XLM-R$_{\text{Large}}$ show that \emph{GradDrop} outperforms standard fine-tuning and gradual unfreezing, while being competitive against methods that use additional translated data and intermediate pretraining.

For dialogue summarization, the subdomain of text summarization, utterances are concatenated to flat text before being processed. As a result, existing summarization systems based on pre-trained models are unable to recognize the unique format of the speaker-utterance pair well in the dialogue. To investigate this issue, we conduct probing tests and manual analysis, and find that the powerful pre-trained model can not identify different speakers well in the conversation, which leads to various factual errors. Moreover, we propose three speaker-aware supervised contrastive learning (SCL) tasks: Token-level SCL, Turn-level SCL, and Global-level SCL.

In this paper, we introduce a framework to learn cross-lingual word embeddings, without assuming isometry, for low-resource pairs via joint exploitation of a related higher-resource language. Both the source and target monolingual embeddings are independently aligned to the related language, enabling the use of offline methods.

However, semantic mismatch between an image and sentences usually happens in finer grain, i.e., phrase level. In this paper, we explore to introduce additional phrase-level supervision for the better identification of mismatched units in the text. In practice, multi-grained semantic labels are automatically constructed for a query image in both sentence-level and phrase-level. We construct text scene graphs for the matched sentences and extract entities and triples as the phrase-level labels. In order to integrate both supervision of sentence-level and phrase-level, we propose Semantic Structure Aware Multimodal Transformer (SSAMT) for multi-modal representation learning. Inside the SSAMT, we utilize different kinds of attention mechanisms to enforce interactions of multi-grain semantic units in both sides of vision and language. For the training, we propose multi-scale matching losses from both global and local perspectives, and penalize mismatched phrases.

We interpret the task of controllable generation as drawing samples from an energy-based model whose energy values are a linear combination of scores from blackbox models that are separately responsible for fluency, the control attribute, and faithfulness to any conditioning context. We use a Metropolis Hastings sampling scheme to sample from this energy-based model using bidirectional context and global attribute features.

Granularity level of the summary is a core component of these preferences. However, most existing studies focus solely on single-granularity scenarios, resulting in models that are limited to producing summaries with similar semantic coverage and are not customizable. In this paper, we propose the first unsupervised multi-granularity summarization framework, GranuSum. We regard events as basic semantic units of the original text and design a model that can take these events as anchors when generating summary. Meanwhile, by ranking these hint events and controlling the number of events, GranuSum is capable of generating summaries at different granularities in an unsupervised manner. We develop a testbed for the multi-granularity summarization task, including a new human-annotated benchmark GranuDUC where each document is paired with multiple summaries with different granularities. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and other large-scale datasets show that GranuSum substantially outperforms previous baselines.

We benchmark our method on two collections of text classification tasks: LAMA and BinaryClfs. Compared to MAML which adapts the model through gradient descent, our method leverages the inductive bias of pre-trained LMs to perform pattern matching, and outperforms MAML by an absolute $6\%$ average AUC-ROC score on BinaryClfs, gaining more advantage with increasing model size. Compared to non-fine-tuned in-context learning (i.e. prompting a raw LM), in-context tuning meta-trains the model to learn from in-context examples.

We investigate this question by training recurrent neural network grammars (RNNGs) using various conversion methods, and evaluating them empirically in a multilingual setting.

On average, the performance of our best model represents a 19 \% increase in accuracy over the worst choice across all languages.

Based on the sparsity of named entities, we also theoretically derive a lower bound for the probability of zero missampling rate, which is only relevant to sentence length. The other contribution is an adaptive and weighted sampling distribution that further improves negative sampling via our former analysis. Experiments on synthetic datasets and well-annotated datasets (e.g., CoNLL-2003) show that our proposed approach benefits negative sampling in terms of F1 score and loss convergence.

A UNMT model is trained on the pseudo parallel data with $\text{\bf translated source}$, and translates $\text{\bf natural source}$ sentences in inference. The source discrepancy between training and inference hinders the translation performance of UNMT models. By carefully designing experiments, we identify two representative characteristics of the data gap in source: (1) $\text{\textit{style gap}}$ (i.e., translated vs. natural text style) that leads to poor generalization capability; (2) $\text{\textit{content gap}}$ that induces the model to produce hallucination content biased towards the target language. To narrow the data gap, we propose an online self-training approach, which simultaneously uses the pseudo parallel data $\{$natural source, translated target$\}$ to mimic the inference scenario.

EI9qCtD7u54,SegMix: A Simple Structure-Aware Data Augmentation Method,"Many Natural Language Processing tasks involve predicting structures, such as Syntax Parsing and Relation Extraction (RE). One central challenge in supervised structured prediction is the lack of high-quality annotated data. The recently proposed interpolation-based data augmentation (DA) algorithms (i.e. mixup) augment the training set via making convex interpolation between training data points. However, current algorithms (e.g. SeqMix, LADA) that apply mixup to language structured prediction tasks are not aware of the syntactic or output structures of the tasks, making their performance unstable and requiring additional heuristic constraints. Furthermore, SeqMix-like algorithms expect a linear encoding scheme of the output structure, such as BIO-Scheme for Named Entity Recognition (NER), restricting its applicability.  To this end, we propose SegMix, a simple framework of interpolation-based algorithms that can adapt to both the syntactic and output structures, making it robust to hyper-parameters and applicable to different tasks.

_9uQwEX4Hpb,"Same Neurons, Different Languages: Probing Morphosyntax in Multilingual Pre-trained Models","The success of multilingual pre-trained models in transferring knowledge cross-lingually is underpinned by their ability to learn representations shared by multiple languages even in absence of any explicit supervision. However, it remains unclear how. In this work, we conjecture that multilingual pre-trained models can derive language-universal abstractions about grammar. In particular, we investigate whether morphosyntactic information is encoded in the same subset of neurons in different languages. We conduct the first large-scale empirical study over 43 typologically diverse languages and 14 morphosyntactic categories with a state-of-the-art neuron-level probe. Our findings show that the cross-lingual overlap between neurons is significant, but its extent may vary across categories and depends on language proximity and pre-training data size.",november,True,9.223863156333922,-24.322139383509246
gHwU02F1sVU,Improving Multimodal Speech Recognition by Data Augmentation and Speech Representations,"Multimodal speech recognition aims to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems by leveraging additional visual information that is usually associated to the audio input. While previous approaches make crucial use of strong visual representations, e.g. by finetuning pretrained image recognition networks, significantly less attention has been paid to its counterpart: the speech component. In this work, we investigate ways of improving the base speech recognition system by following similar techniques to the ones used for the visual encoder, namely, transferring representations and data augmentation. First, we show that starting from a pretrained ASR significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance; interestingly, even when building upon a strong unimodal system, we still find gains by including the visual modality. Second, we employ speech data augmentation techniques to encourage the multimodal system to attend to the visual stimuli. This technique replaces previously used word masking and comes with the benefits of being conceptually simpler and yielding consistent improvements in the multimodal setting. We back up our conclusions by empirical results on three multimodal datasets, including the newly introduced Localized Narratives.",november,True,18.42603581505263,-16.555618577399326
MHnRhU7zmDX,Learning Universal Sentence Embeddings with Large-scale Parallel Translation Datasets,"Although contrastive learning has greatly improved sentence representation, its performance is still limited by the size of monolingual sentence-pair datasets. Meanwhile, there exist large-scale parallel translation pairs (100x larger than monolingual pairs) that are highly correlated in semantic, but have not been utilized for learning universal sentence representation. Furthermore, given parallel translation pairs, previous contrastive learning frameworks can not well balance the monolingual embeddings’ alignment and uniformity which represent the quality of embeddings. In this paper, we build on the top of dual encoder and propose to freeze the source language encoder, utilizing its consistent embeddings to supervise the target language encoder via contrastive learning, where source-target translation pairs are regarded as positives. We provide the first exploration of utilizing parallel translation sentence pairs to learn universal sentence embeddings and show superior performance to balance the alignment and uniformity. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the average score of standard semantic textual similarity (STS), outperforming both SimCSE and Sentence-T5, and the best performance in corresponding tracks on transfer tasks.",november,True,8.039467880143746,-0.7190802738650593

Recent work has explored using counterfactually-augmented data (CAD)---data generated by minimally perturbing examples to flip the ground-truth label---to identify robust features that are invariant under distribution shift. However, empirical results using CAD during training for OOD generalization have been mixed. To explain this discrepancy, through a toy theoretical example and empirical analysis on two crowdsourced CAD datasets, we show that: (a) while features perturbed in CAD are indeed robust features, it may prevent the model from learning unperturbed robust features; and (b) CAD may exacerbate existing spurious correlations in the data. Our results thus show that the lack of perturbation diversity limits CAD's effectiveness on OOD generalization, calling for innovative crowdsourcing procedures to elicit diverse perturbation of examples.",november,True,6.3496072119680065,-7.315973802062033

Previous works have shown that these datasets sometimes contain downstream test sets, a phenomenon typically referred to as ""data contamination"". It is not clear however to what extent models exploit the contaminated data for downstream tasks. In this paper we present a principled method to study this question. We pretrain BERT models on joint corpora of Wikipedia and labeled downstream datasets, and fine-tune them on the relevant task.  Comparing performance between samples seen and unseen during pretraining enables us to define and quantify levels of memorization and exploitation. Our experiments with two models and three downstream tasks indicate that exploitation exists in some cases, but in others the models  memorize the contaminated data, but do not exploit it. We show these two measures are affected by different factors such as contaminated data occurrences, model size, and random seeds. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing massive web-scale datasets to verify that progress in NLP is obtained by better language understanding and not better data exploitation.",november,True,0.10964805852184752,-8.22115069420494

We propose a model in which social uncertainty is mitigated first through automatic modes of inference (such as impression generation), before more control-demanding modes of inference (such as perspective-taking) are used to narrow one's expectations even further. Finally, social uncertainty is reduced further by allocating resources to update these predictions based on newer inputs.

We claim that the proposed model is capable of representing all prototypes and samples from both classes to a more consistent distribution in the global space.

Most of the past studies have focused on reducing the demand for parallel corpus or making more effective use of limited parallel corpus. In this work, we have studied a method of using ambiguity of syntactic structure to achieve more effective use of monolingual corpus. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks for various languages show that our method has a greater improvement than the method using back-translation only, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.",november,True,18.62787412251896,-26.096859431670083

JUrlIlxIEun,Seq2rel: A sequence-to-sequence-based approach for document-level relation extraction,"Motivated by the fact that many relations cross the sentence boundary, there has been increasing interest in document-level relation extraction (RE). Document-level RE requires integrating information within and across sentences, capturing complex interactions between mentions of interacting entities. Most document-level RE methods proposed to date are pipeline-based, requiring entities as input. However, previous work has demonstrated that jointly learning to extract entities and relations can improve performance and be more efficient due to shared parameters and training steps. In this paper, we develop a sequence-to-sequence-based approach that can learn the sub-tasks of document-level RE --- entity extraction, coreference resolution and relation extraction --- in an end-to-end fashion. We evaluate our approach on several datasets, in some cases exceeding the performance of existing methods. Finally, we demonstrate that, under our model, the end-to-end approach outperforms a pipeline-based approach.

Typically, prompt-based tuning wraps the input text into a cloze question. To make predictions, the model maps the output words to labels via a verbalizer, which is either manually designed or automatically built. However, manual verbalizers heavily depend on domain-specific prior knowledge and human efforts, while finding appropriate label words automatically still remains challenging.In this work, we propose the prototypical verbalizer (ProtoVerb) which is built directly from training data. Specifically, ProtoVerb learns prototype vectors as verbalizers by contrastive learning. In this way, the prototypes summarize training instances and are able to enclose rich class-level semantics. We conduct experiments on both topic classification and entity typing tasks, and the results demonstrate that ProtoVerb significantly outperforms current automatic verbalizers, especially when training data is extremely scarce. More surprisingly, ProtoVerb consistently boosts prompt-based tuning even on untuned PLMs, indicating an elegant non-tuning way to utilize PLMs.",november,True,-4.449653491763623,-24.50294854504344

However, the student model needs to be large in this operation.  Otherwise, its performance will drop sharply, thus making it impractical to be deployed to memory-limited devices. To address this issue, we delve into cross-lingual knowledge distillation and propose a multi-stage distillation framework for constructing a small-size but high-performance cross-lingual model. In our framework, the contrastive learning and an assistant model are introduced to prevent performance from being compromised during the compression process. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can compress the size of XLM-R and MiniLM by more than 50%, while the performance is only reduced by about 1%. In addition, our framework is model-independent and applicable to all transformer-based models.",november,True,11.260867127326469,-27.272275208336236

S7bmlbwUV8,Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models,"The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. Pruning methods start from a large model and gradually remove model weights---they can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve impressive runtime efficiency. On the other hand, distillation methods start from a shallower, compact model and can obtain large speedups---however, they are costly to train on large amounts of unlabeled data. In this work, we show that structured pruning can match the distillation counterparts in both latency ($>$10$\times$) and accuracy ($>$92\%) and result in highly compact and efficient subnetworks. Unlike distillation, our task-specific pruning approach, {\ours}, does not need to pre-specify the model architecture nor rely on unlabeled data. Our solution is to jointly prune layers and sub-modules such as heads and hidden units in Transformer models through $l_0$ regularization while ensuring that the resulting model is parallelizable. We also propose a layerwise distillation approach to further guide pruning. Finally, our pruned structures reveal interesting patterns---for example, more than 70\% of feed-forward and 50\% of self-attention layers can be easily pruned, while the first and last 1-2 layers are likely to remain for highly compressed models.",november,True,6.8953161765985875,-40.215649811474165

We show our interest in accelerating such a process and find that traditional Information Retrieval based methods fail to handle the long and complex questions in coding forums and thus cannot find the suitable coding repositories. In order to bridge the semantic gap between repositories and real-world coding questions effectively and efficiently, we introduce a specialized dataset named Repo4QA, which includes over 12,000 question-repository pairs constructed from Stack Overflow and Github. Furthermore, we propose QuReCL, a contrastive learning model based on CodeBERT, to jointly learn the representation of both questions and repositories. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can simultaneously capture the semantic features in both questions and repositories through jointly embedding, and outperforms existing state-of-art methods.

Previous text-editing-based methods augment the text in a non-selective manner: the words in the text are treated without difference during augmentation, which may result in unsatisfactory augmented samples. In this work, we present four kinds of roles of words (ROWs) which have different functions in text classification tasks, and design effective methods to automatically extract these ROWs based on statistical and semantic perspectives. Systematic experiments are conducted on what ROWs should (n't) be augmented during augmentation for classification tasks. Based on these experiments, we discover some interesting and instructive potential patterns that certain ROWs are especially suitable or unsuitable for certain augmentation operations. Guided by these patterns, we propose a set of Selective Text Augmentation (STA) operations, which significantly outperform traditional methods and show outstanding generalization performance.

This confidence measure is usually uncalibrated; i.e.\ the system's confidence in the prediction does not match the true probability of the predicted output. In this paper, we present an investigation into calibrating open setting machine reading systems such as open-domain question answering and claim verification systems. We show that calibrating such complex systems which contain discrete retrieval and deep reading components is challenging and current calibration techniques fail to scale to these settings.  We propose simple extensions to existing calibration approaches that allows us to adapt them to these settings.

Recent approaches rely on pretrained Transformer-based models, but it remains unknown whether the differences between them, such as size, pretraining data and objectives, affect their coherence modeling capacity. We present a simple architecture for sentence ordering that relies exclusively on pretrained Transformer-based encoder-only models. This allows us to compare the coherence modeling capabilities of the monolingual and multilingual versions of BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. We show that RoBERTa-based models outperform BERT-based models and are more robust when ordering longer documents with more than 10 sentences. Thus, the intuitive advantage offered by sentence-based objectives such as Next Sentence Prediction used in BERT is effectively compensated by the higher amount and diversity of the training data used in RoBERTa. However, the difference between multilingual versions of BERT and RoBERTa is narrower. This suggests that exposure to  different languages partially makes up for the benefits of larger and more diverse training data.",november,True,-9.852639749631418,-6.473973605066294

Automatic depression diagnosis methods have been a new research focus.  In particular, automatic dialogue-based diagnosis systems are desired since depression diagnosis highly relies on clinical consultation. Based on clinical diagnosis criteria, doctors initiate a conversation with ample emotional support that guides the patients to expose their symptoms.  Such a dialog is a combination of task-oriented and chitchat, different from traditional single-purpose human-machine dialog systems.  However, due to the social stigma associated with mental illness, the dialogue data related to the diagnosis of actual patients are rarely disclosed. The lack of data has become one of the major factors restricting the research on the consultation dialogue system of depression. %Although there are effective methods of diagnosis and treatment for depression, more than 75\% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment.

Such methods usually consist of a learner as the classifier and a meta learner for specializing the learner to tasks. For the learner, learning rate is crucial to its performance. However, existing methods treat it as a hyper parameter and adjust it manually, which is time-consuming and laborious. Intuitively, for different tasks and neural network layers, the learning rates should be different and self-adaptive. For the meta learner, it requires a good generalization ability so as to quickly adapt to new tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel meta learning framework, called MetaCLSLR, for few-shot text classification. Specifically, we present a novel meta learning mechanism to obtain different learning rates for different tasks and neural network layers so as to enable the learner to quickly adapt to new training data. Moreover, we propose a task-oriented curriculum learning mechanism to help the meta learner achieve a better generalization ability by learning from different tasks with increasing difficulties.

This hinders the community from measuring sophisticated understanding of RC systems. MRC questions whose answers can be rightly predicted without understanding their contexts are defined as biased ones. Previous researches aimed to split unintended biases and determine their influence have some limitations. Some methods using partial test data to extract biases lack holistic consideration with question-context-option tuple. Others relied on artificial statistical features are limited by question types.  In this paper, we employ two simple heuristics to identify biased questions in current MRC datasets through human-annotated keywords. We implement three neural networks on the biased data and find that they have outstanding abilities to capture the biases, and further study the superficial features of the biased data exploited by models as shortcuts in views of lexical choice and paragraphs. Experiments show that (i) models can answer some questions merely using several keywords which are unanswerable or difficulty for human.

SshQlYuME_,A Neural Approach to KGQA via SPARQL Silhouette Generation,"Semantic  parsing  is  a  predominant  approach  to  solve  the Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) task where, natural language question is translated into a logic form such as  SPARQL.  Semantic  parsing  based  solutions  are  mostly modular/pipelined where, noise introduced by the upstream modules  for  entity/relation  linking  makes  it  hard  to  solve the  complex  questions.  Recently,  Neural  Machine  Translation (NMT) based  approaches have emerged  that are capable of handling complex questions. However, NMT-based approaches struggle with handling the large number of test entities and relations that are unseen during training. In this work,we propose a modular two-stage neural approach which combines best of both the worlds - NMT and semantic parsing pipeline. Stage-I of our approach comprises an NMT-based seq2seq module that translates a question into a sketch of the desired  SPARQL,  called  as SPARQL silhouette.  This  stage also contains a noise simulator which combines the masking scheme  with  an  entity/relation  linker  in  a  novel  manner  so as to take care of unseen entities/relation without blowing up the vocabulary of seq2seq module. Stage-II of our approach comprises a Neural Graph Search (NGS) module which aims to distil the SPARQL silhouette in order to reduce the entity/relation linking noise.   Experimental results show that, the quality of generated SPARQL silhouette is impressive for an ideal scenario where entity/relation linker is noise-free. For the realistic scenario (i.e. noisy linker), the quality of the SPARQL silhouette drops but  our NGS module recovers it considerably.

H3Fp5M4M8fO,Towards Collaborative Neural-Symbolic Graph Semantic Parsing via Uncertainty,"Recent work in task-independent graph semantic parsing has shifted from grammar-based symbolic approaches to data-intensive neural approaches, and has shown strong performance on different types of meaning representations.  However, it is still unclear that what are the limitations of these neural parsers, and whether these limitations can be compensated by collaborating with symbolic parsers. In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions by taking English Resource Grammar (ERG) parsing as a case study. Specifically, we first develop a state-of-the-art neural ERG parser, and then conduct detailed analyses on fine-grained linguistic phenomena. The results suggest that the neural parser's performance degrades significantly on long-tail examples, while the symbolic parser performs more robustly. To address this, we further propose a collaborative neural-symbolic semantic parsing framework. Specifically, we improve the beam search strategy by designing a decision criterion that incorporates both the model uncertainty about the testing data distribution and the prior knowledge from a symbolic parser. Experimental results show that this collaborative parsing framework can outperform the single neural parser and concretely improve the model's performance on long-tail examples.",november,True,3.4534144126103206,6.539702895787367

In this work, we propose an innovative framework PNLL that remedies the catastrophic forgetting issues with a power normalization on NLP transformer models.

First, as recent improvements in entity linking suggest learning mention detection explicitly could increase performance, we train mention detection as an auxiliary task. Second, previous work suggests that re-ranking could help correct prediction errors. We add a new, auxiliary task, match prediction, to learn re-ranking. Without the use of a knowledge base or candidate sets, our model sets a new state of the art in two benchmark datasets of entity linking: COMETA in the biomedical domain, and AIDA-CoNLL in the news domain. We show through ablation studies that each of the two auxiliary tasks increases performance, and that re-ranking is an important factor to the increase.

However, with limited persona-based dialogue data at hand, it may be difficult to train a dialogue generation model well. We point out that the data challenges of this generation task lie in two aspects: first, it is expensive to scale up current persona-based dialogue datasets; second, each data sample in this task is more complex to learn with than conventional dialogue data. To alleviate the above data issues, we propose a data manipulation method, which is model-agnostic to be packed with any persona-based dialogue generation model to improve their performance. The original training samples will first be distilled and thus expected to be fitted more easily. Next, we show various effective ways that can diversify such easier distilled data.

We focus on studying the impact of the jointly pretrained decoder, which is the main difference between Seq2Seq pretraining and previous encoder-based pretraining approaches for NMT. By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy). Based on these observations, we further propose simple and effective strategies, named in-domain pretraining and input adaptation to remedy the domain and objective discrepancies, respectively. Experimental results on several language pairs show that our approach can consistently improve both translation performance and model robustness upon Seq2Seq pretraining.",november,True,20.654411544173275,-30.621697631415277

We argue that the last-layer features may not be sufficient for predicting labels at different levels of semantic granularity, and that multi-layer features may offer a better choice instead.

Our goal is to improve a low-resource semantic parser using utterances collected through user interactions. In this highly challenging but realistic setting, we investigate data augmentation approaches involving generating a set of structured canonical utterances corresponding to logical forms, before simulating corresponding natural language and filtering the resulting pairs.

Further, to tackle the zero-shot regime, we propose a self-supervised strategy that carries out distribution-level optimization in prompt-learning to automatically summarize the information of entity types. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained entity typing benchmarks (with up to 86 classes) under fully supervised, few-shot and zero-shot settings show that prompt-learning methods significantly outperform fine-tuning baselines, especially when the training data is insufficient.

In this paper, we extend the Minecraft Corpus Dataset by annotating all builder utterances into eight types, including clarification questions, and propose a new builder agent model capable of determining when to ask or execute instructions. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the collaborative building task with a substantial improvement. We also provide baselines for the new tasks, learning to ask and the joint tasks, which consists in solving both collaborating building and learning to ask tasks jointly.",november,True,-13.53943020499296,3.3820951586365675

YTGg7kv8qIq,Enabling Multimodal Generation on CLIP via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation,"The recent large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) of dual-stream architectures (e.g., CLIP) with a tremendous amount of image-text pair data, has shown its superiority on various multimodal alignment tasks. Despite its success, the resulting models are not capable of generative multimodal tasks due to the weak text encoder. To tackle this problem, we propose to augment the dual-stream VLP model with a textual pre-trained language model (PLM) via vision-language knowledge distillation (VLKD), enabling the capability for multimodal generation. VLKD is pretty data- and computation-efficient compared to the pre-training from scratch. Experimental results show that the resulting model has strong zero-shot performance on multimodal generation tasks, such as open-ended visual question answering and image captioning. For example, it achieves 39.7% zero-shot accuracy on the VQA 2.0 dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art zero-shot model with 14x fewer parameters. Furthermore, the original text processing ability of the PLM is maintained after VLKD, which makes our model versatile for both multimodal and unimodal tasks.",november,True,24.958925547975582,-4.464397235634353

nB4zLyclbom,"When classifying grammatical role, BERT doesn't care about word order... except when it matters","Because meaning can often be inferred from lexical semantics alone, word order is often a redundant cue in natural language. For example, the words cut, chef, and onion are more likely used to convey ""The chef cut the onion,"" not ""The onion cut the chef."" Recent work has shown large language models to be surprisingly word order invariant, but crucially has largely considered natural prototypical inputs, where compositional meaning mostly matches lexical expectations. To overcome this confound, we probe grammatical role representation in BERT and GPT-2 on non-prototypical instances. Such instances are naturally occurring sentences with inanimate subjects or animate objects, or sentences where we systematically swap the arguments to make sentences like ""The onion cut the chef"".  We find that, while early layer embeddings are largely lexical, word order is in fact crucial in defining the later-layer representations of words in semantically non-prototypical positions. Our experiments isolate the effect of word order on the contextualization process, and highlight how models use context in the uncommon, but critical, instances where it matters.

Our results can be extremely helpful for historians, in advancing research in history and in understanding the socio-political landscape of a country as reflected in the writings of political leaders/scholars.

Cr23m4deFPF,Towards Asking Clarification Questions in Task-Oriented Dialogue,"Task-oriented dialogues aim at providing users with task-specific services. To provide satisfactory services, two major challenges exist: 1) users are not able to fully describe their complex needs due to lack of task knowledge, and; 2) systems need to personalize the service to their users since different users have different profiles and preferences. In order to solve these challenges, systems need to be able to ask questions so as to clarify the user's profile and needs. However, existing task-oriented dialogue systems ignore this aspect. In this paper, we formulate the problem of asking clarification questions in task-oriented dialogue systems. To this end, we propose a dialogue-based user simulator to collect a dataset, called TaskClariQ\footnote{To foster research in this area, the dataset and code will be made public upon paper’s acceptance.}.

It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology.

Our method addresses cross-lingual UMLS NEL in a low resource setting, where the ontology is large, there is a lack of descriptive text defining most entities, and labeled data can only cover a small portion of the ontology.

However, the cross-modal attention models of existing methods could be sub-optimal and inaccurate because there is no direct supervision provided during the training process. In this work, we propose two novel training strategies, namely Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and Contrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints, to address such limitations. These constraints supervise the training of cross-modal attention models in a contrastive learning manner without requiring explicit attention annotations. They are plug-in training strategies and can be easily integrated into existing cross-modal attention models. Additionally, we introduce three metrics including Attention Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to quantitatively measure the quality of learned attention models. We evaluate the proposed constraints by incorporating them into four state-of-the-art cross-modal attention-based image-text matching models.

bmCKitFWGD0,Knowledgeable Prompt-tuning: Incorporating Knowledge into Prompt Verbalizer for Text Classification,"Tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) with task-specific prompts has been a promising approach for text classification. Particularly, previous studies suggest that prompt-tuning has remarkable superiority in the low-data scenario over the generic fine-tuning methods with extra classifiers. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces, i.e., template, to the input and transform a classification problem into a masked language modeling problem, where a crucial step is to construct a projection, i.e., verbalizer, between a label space and a label word space. A verbalizer is usually handcrafted or searched by gradient descent, which may lack coverage and bring considerable bias and high variances to the results. In this work, we focus on incorporating external knowledge into the verbalizer, forming a knowledgeable prompttuning (KPT), to improve and stabilize prompttuning. Specifically, we expand the label word space of the verbalizer using external knowledge bases (KBs) and refine the expanded label word space with the PLM itself before predicting with the expanded label word space. Extensive experiments on zero and few-shot text classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledgeable prompt-tuning.",november,True,-4.479107610294434,-25.002059885033788

Euk0_paHyqD,PALBERT: Teaching ALBERT to Ponder,"Currently, pre-trained models can be considered the default choice for a wide range of NLP tasks. Despite their SoTA results, there is practical evidence that these models may require a different number of computing layers for different input sequences, since evaluating all layers leads to overconfidence on wrong predictions (namely overthinking). This problem can potentially be solved by implementing adaptive computation time approaches, which were first designed to improve inference speed.  Recently proposed PonderNet may be a promising solution for performing an early exit by treating the exit layer's index as a latent variable. However, the originally proposed exit criterion, relying on sampling from trained posterior distribution on the probability of exiting from $i$-th layer, introduces major variance in model outputs, significantly reducing the resulting model's performance.  In this paper, we propose Ponder ALBERT (PALBERT) – an improvement to PonderNet with a novel deterministic Q-exit criterion and a revisited model architecture. We compared PALBERT with recent methods for performing an early exit. We observed that the proposed changes can be considered significant improvements on the original PonderNet architecture and outperform PABEE on a wide range of GLUE tasks.

Unlike existing character-based attacks which often deductively hypothesize a set of manipulation strategies, our work is grounded on actual observations from real-world texts. We find that adversarial texts generated by ANTHRO achieve the best trade-off between (1) attack success rate, (2) semantic preservation of the original text, and (3) stealthiness--i.e. indistinguishable from human writings hence harder to be flagged as suspicious. Specifically, our attacks accomplished around 83% and 91% attack success rates on BERT and RoBERTa, respectively. Moreover, it outperformed the TextBugger baseline with an increase of 50% and 40% in terms of semantic preservation and stealthiness when evaluated by both layperson and professional human workers.

We experimentally find that: (1) Self-Debias is the strongest debiasing technique, obtaining improved scores on all bias benchmarks; (2) Current debiasing techniques perform less consistently when mitigating non-gender biases; And (3) improvements on bias benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs by using debiasing strategies are often accompanied by a decrease in language modeling ability, making it difficult to determine whether the bias mitigation was effective.",november,True,10.625573950838646,-14.098851203267403

33HlPgIEJ3n,Self-Distilled Pruning of Neural Networks,"Pruning aims to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining performance close to the original network. This work proposes a novel \emph{self-distillation} based pruning strategy, whereby the representational similarity between the pruned and unpruned versions of the same network is maximized. Unlike previous approaches that treat distillation and pruning separately, we use distillation to inform the pruning criteria, without requiring a separate student network as in knowledge distillation. We show that the proposed {\em cross-correlation objective for self-distilled pruning} implicitly encourages sparse solutions, naturally complementing magnitude-based pruning criteria. Experiments on the GLUE  and XGLUE benchmarks show that self-distilled pruning increases mono- and cross-lingual language model performance. Self-distilled pruned models also outperform smaller Transformers with an equal number of parameters and are competitive against (6 times) larger distilled networks. We also observe that self-distillation (1) maximizes class separability, (2) increases the signal-to-noise ratio, and (3) converges faster after pruning steps, providing further insights into why self-distilled pruning improves generalization.

IezTlW7ERIm,Augmenting Memory Networks for Rich and Efficient Retrieval in Grounded Dialogue,"Grounded dialogue consists of conditioning a conversation on additional latent inputs (""factoids"") beyond the dialogue context, such as Wikipedia articles, IMDB reviews, persona, and images.  Due to a scarcity of <context, factoid> labels, it is common practice to jointly learn the knowledge-selection and grounded response generation tasks end-to-end. When conditioning the response on these factoids, previous work has either treated the factoids as a weighed average vector, or separately computed probabilities for each <context, factoid> pair. However, the former creates a bottleneck whilst the latter prevents factoids from being considered jointly. Our new method, PolyMemNet, learns a matrix representation of the context and factoids, allowing for multiple factoids to be jointly considered in response selection, without imposing a bottleneck. We show how this achieves up to a $17\%$ boost in knowledge-selection accuracy and $13\%$ in response-selection accuracy versus memory networks. ",november,True,-11.126159763451147,12.156294717104345

Unfortunately, for in-context learning there is currently no way to leverage unlabeled data, which is often much easier to obtain in large quantities than labeled examples. In this work, we therefore investigate ways to make use of unlabeled examples to improve the zero-shot performance of pretrained language models without any finetuning: We introduce Semantic-Oriented Unlabeled Priming (SOUP), a method that classifies examples by retrieving semantically similar unlabeled examples, assigning labels to them in a zero-shot fashion, and then using them for in-context learning.

CBaAwVcAd2G,Reasoning Like Program Executors,"Reasoning over natural language is a long-standing goal for the research community. However, studies have shown that existing language models are inadequate in reasoning. To address the issue, we present POET, a new pre-training paradigm. Through pre-training language models with programs and their execution results, POET empowers language models to harvest the reasoning knowledge possessed in program executors via a data-driven approach. POET is conceptually simple and can be instantiated by different kinds of programs. In this paper, we show three empirically powerful instances, i.e., POET-Math, POET-Logic, and POET-SQL. Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate that POET can significantly boost model performance on natural language reasoning, such as numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. Taking the DROP benchmark as a representative example, POET improves the F1 metric of BART from 69.2% to 80.6%. Furthermore, POET shines in giant language models, pushing the F1 metric of T5-11B to 87.6% and achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on DROP.

Experimental results show that our cross-lingual model not only outperforms baselines by large margins but it is also robust to low-resource scenarios. More importantly, we confirm the usefulness of CSRL to English conversational tasks such as question-in-context rewriting and multi-turn dialogue response generation by incorporating the CSRL information into the downstream conversation-based models.

We have positive results to support both assumptions. The conclusion is that speakers indeed use simple gestures to convey information that enhances verbal communication, and how this information is organized is a rational process.

_5lTEMDR2e1,EIDER: Evidence-enhanced Document-level Relation Extraction,"Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to extract the semantic relations among entity pairs in a document. Typical DocRE methods blindly take the full document as input, while a subset of the sentences in a document, noted as the evidence, are often sufficient for humans to predict the relation of an entity pair. In this paper, we propose an evidence-enhanced DocRE framework called Eider that automatically extracts and leverages evidence. We first train an evidence extraction model together with relation extraction via multi-task learning, which allows the two tasks to benefit from shared representations and improve each other. Experiments show that even if human annotation of evidence is unavailable, using silver evidence labels extracted by heuristic rules still leads to better RE performance. We further design a simple yet effective evidence-enhanced inference process that makes RE predictions on both extracted evidence and the full document and fuses the predictions through a blending layer. This allows Eider to focus on the important context while still having access to all the information in the document. Extensive experiments show that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, e.g., by 1.37/1.26 Ign F1/F1 on DocRED. ",november,True,-29.47752991860161,10.377712055774209

Omw-DFgi6S,High Interpretable Transfer Network for Aspect Level Sentiment Classification,"Aspect-level affective classification (ASC) aims to detect the affective polarity of a given viewpoint target in a sentence. In the ASC method based on neural network, most of the work uses the attention mechanism to capture the sentiment words corresponding to the opinion target, and then gather them as evidence to infer the emotion of the target. However, due to the complexity of annotation, the scale of aspect level data sets is relatively small. Data scarcity leads to the attention mechanism sometimes unable to pay attention to the sentiment words corresponding to the target, which finally weakens the performance of the neural model. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a complete High Interpretable Transfer Network transfer learning framework (HITN), which adopts methods such as data enhancement, attention adjustment and transfer to effectively improve the performance of ASC model.

Such a ``head-to-head'' and ``tail-to-tail'' alignment strategy greatly reduces the computational complexity of coreference decisions on any pair of mentions, mitigates the error propagation problem caused by mention pruning, and encourages the sharing of features across all mentions that refer to the same entity.

The meaning of a word in Chinese is different in that a word is a compositional unit consisting of multiple characters. Such difference motivates us to investigate whether WWM leads to better context understanding ability for Chinese BERT. To achieve this, we introduce two probing tasks related to grammatical error correction and ask pretrained models to revise or insert tokens in a masked language modeling manner. We construct a dataset including labels for 19,075 tokens in 10,448 sentences. We train three Chinese BERT models with standard character-level masking (CLM), WWM, and a combination of CLM and WWM, respectively. Our major findings are as follows: First, when one character needs to be inserted or replaced, the model trained with CLM performs the best. Second, when more than one character needs to be handled, WWM is the key to better performance. Finally, when being fine-tuned on sentence-level downstream tasks, models trained with different masking strategies perform comparably.",november,True,-14.897818423477803,-20.087002617581067

-eOO1r7NB7N,Context-Paraphrase Enhanced Commonsense Question Answering,"Commonsense question answering (CQA) generally means that the machine use the mastered commonsense to answer questions without relevant background material, which is a challenging task in natural language processing. Many prior methods mainly retrieve question related evidences from the structured knowledge base as the background material of the question, while the extracted evidence is generally described through the entities and the relationship between the entities, making it difficult for the machine to understand the meaning of the evidence completely. In this paper, we integrate the paraphrase in WordNet and Wiktionary into the evidence extraction process and machine reading comprehension (MRC) model, and propose a context-paraphrase enhanced commonsense question answering method. Specifically, the context-paraphrase obtained by WordNet and Wiktionary is first incorporated into the construction process of the heterogeneous graph, and the question related triple is extracted based on the heterogeneous graph, the triple is converted to triple-text based on a relational template. Then, the triple-text is used as the context of the question to establish an association graph containing the relationship between the context entities and the paraphrases. We further integrate the association graph into the MRC model to better guide the model to answer.

Nctx6hVAQYf,ERNIE-SPARSE: Learning Hierarchical Efficient Transformer Through Regularized Self-Attention,"Sparse Transformer has recently attracted a lot of attention since the ability for reducing the quadratic dependency on the sequence length. We argue that two factors, information bottleneck sensitivity and inconsistency between different attention topologies, could affect the performance of the Sparse Transformer. This paper proposes a well-designed model named ERNIE-Sparse. It consists of two distinctive parts: (i) Hierarchical Sparse Transformer (HST) to sequentially unify local and global information. (ii) Self-Attention Regularization (SAR) method, a novel regularization designed to minimize the distance for transformers with different attention topologies. To evaluate the effectiveness of ERNIE-Sparse, we perform extensive evaluations. Firstly, we perform experiments on a multi-modal long sequence modeling task benchmark, Long Range Arena (LRA). Experimental results demonstrate that ERNIE-Sparse significantly outperforms a variety of strong baseline methods including the dense attention and other efficient sparse attention methods and achieves improvements by 2.77% (57.78% vs. 55.01%). Secondly, to further show the effectiveness of our method, we pretrain ERNIE-Sparse and verified it on 3 text classification and 2 QA downstream tasks, achieve improvements on classification benchmark by 0.83% (92.46% vs. 91.63%), on QA benchmark by 3.24% (74.67% vs. 71.43%). Experimental results continue to demonstrate its superior performance.  ",november,True,21.88671845704067,-7.00812310791667

8UJrIgq1m0j,"Hey AI, Can You Solve Complex Tasks by Talking to Agents?","Training giant models from scratch for each complex task is resource- and data-inefficient. To help develop models that can leverage existing systems, we propose a new challenge: Learning to solve complex tasks by communicating with existing agents (or models) in natural language. We design a synthetic benchmark, CommaQA, with three complex reasoning tasks (explicit, implicit, numeric) designed to be solved by communicating with existing QA agents. For instance, using text and table QA agents to answer questions such as ""Who had the longest javelin throw from USA?"". We show that black-box models struggle to learn this task from scratch (accuracy under 50\%) even with access to each agent's knowledge and gold facts supervision. In contrast, models that learn to communicate with agents outperform black-box models, reaching scores of 100\% when given gold decomposition supervision. However, we show that the challenge of learning to solve complex tasks by communicating with existing agents \emph{without relying on any auxiliary supervision or data} still remains highly elusive. We will release CommaQA, along with a compositional generalization test split, to advance research in this direction.",november,True,-9.156142537850924,0.1671628365988317
irGCnTg9q2Z,Fine-grained Category Discovery under Coarse-grained supervision with Hierarchical Weighted Self-contrastive Learning,"In this paper, we propose a new task named Fine-grained Category Discovery under Coarse-grained supervision (FCDC). Without asking for any fine-grained knowledge, FCDC aims at discovering fine-grained categories with only coarse-grained labeled data, which can not only reduce significant labeling costs, but also adapt to novel fine-grained categories. It is also a challenging task since performing FCDC requires models to ensure fine-grained sample separability with only coarse-grained supervision and can easily make models overfit on the training set. Considering most current methods cannot transfer knowledge from coarse-grained level to fine-grained level, we propose a novel hierarchical weighted self-contrastive network to approach the FCDC task. Inspired by the hierarchy of pre-trained models (e.g. BERT), we combine supervised learning and contrastive learning to learn fine-grained knowledge from shallow to deep. Specifically, we use coarse-grained labels to train bottom layers of our model to learn surface knowledge, then we build a novel weighted self-contrastive module to train top layers of our model to learn more fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show both effectiveness and efficiency of our model over state-of-the-art methods.",november,True,13.886472631951833,6.618286624055115

N-DZvl4bQsO,DAML: Chinese Named Entity Recognition with a fusion method of data-augmentation and meta-learning,"Overfitting is still a common problem in NER with insufficient data. Latest methods such as Transfer Learning, which focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one task and applying it to a different but related task, or Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), which learns a model parameter initialization that generalizes better to similar tasks. However, these methods still need rich resources to pre-train. In this work, we present new perspectives on how to make the most of in-domain and out-domain information. By introducing a fusion method of data augmentation and MAML, we first use data augmentation to mine more information. With the augmented resources, we directly utilize out-domain and in-domain data with MAML, while avoiding performance degradation after domain transfer. To further improve the model’s generalization ability, we proposed a new data augmentation method based on a generative approach. We conduct experiments on six open Chinese NER datasets (MSRANER, PeopleDairyNER, CLUENER, WeiboNER, Resume NER, and BOSONNER).

GO9vQ8BrJtk,Detection of Adversarial Examples in NLP: Benchmark and Baseline via Robust Density Estimation,"Word-level adversarial attacks have shown success in NLP models, drastically decreasing the performance of transformer-based models in recent years. As a counter measure, adversarial defense has been explored, but relatively little efforts have been made to detect adversarial examples. However, detecting adversarial examples in NLP may be crucial for automated task (e.g. review sentiment analysis) that wishes to amass information about a certain population and additionally be a step towards a robust defense system. To this end, we release a dataset for four popular attack methods on three datasets and four NLP models to encourage further research in this field. Along with it, we propose a competitive baseline based on density estimation that has the highest \textsc{auc} on 21 out of 22 dataset-attack-model combinations.\footnote{https://github.com/anoymous92874838/text-adv-detection}",november,True,-22.274811710688923,-19.54043948689659

Dataset growth introduces new challenges: we find that when learning to map inputs to a new symbol from a fixed number of annotations, more data can in fact {\emph{reduce}} the model's performance on examples that involve this new symbol. We show that this trend holds for multiple models on two datasets for common NLU tasks: intent recognition and semantic parsing. We demonstrate that the performance decrease is largely associated with an effect we refer to as source signal dilution, which occurs when strong lexical cues in the training data become diluted as the dataset grows. Selectively dropping training examples to prevent source dilution often reverses the performance decrease, suggesting a direction for improving models.

Its main advantage is that it does not rely on a ground truth to generate test cases. However, existing studies are mostly concerned with robustness-like metamorphic relations, limiting the scope of linguistic properties they can test. We propose three new classes of metamorphic relations, which address the properties of systematicity, compositionality and transitivity. Unlike robustness, our relations are defined over multiple source inputs, thus increasing the number of test cases that we can produce by a polynomial factor. With them, we test the internal consistency of state-of-the-art NLP models, and show that they do not always behave according to their expected linguistic properties. Lastly, we introduce a novel graphical notation that efficiently summarises the inner structure of metamorphic relations.",november,True,-1.3844848226592705,-7.612016768872305

GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25× parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability to different downstream tasks.",november,True,4.592258565665453,-15.147583647030517

Tle_t5AxcTL,An Empirical Study on Explanations in Out-of-Domain Settings,"Recent work in Natural Language Processing has focused on developing approaches that extract faithful explanations, either via identifying the most important tokens in the input (i.e. post-hoc explanations) or by designing inherently faithful models that first select the most important tokens and then use them to predict the correct label (i.e. select-then-predict models). Currently, these approaches are largely evaluated on in-domain settings. Yet, little is known about how post-hoc explanations and inherently faithful models perform in out-of-domain settings. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study that examines: (1) the out-of-domain faithfulness of post-hoc explanations, generated by five feature attribution methods; and (2) the out-of-domain performance of two inherently faithful models over six datasets. Contrary to our expectations, results show that in many cases out-of-domain post-hoc explanation faithfulness measured by sufficiency and comprehensiveness is higher compared to in-domain. We find this misleading and suggest using a random baseline as a yardstick for evaluating post-hoc explanation faithfulness. Our findings also show that select-then predict models demonstrate comparable predictive performance in out-of-domain settings to full-text trained models.",november,True,1.1757667399830085,-2.2201946990899395

In prompt tuning, prompt templates is used to tune pretrained language models (PLMs), which outputs relation types as verbalized type tokens. This strategy shows great potential to support relation extraction because it is effective to take full use of rich knowledge in PLMs. However, current prompt tuning models are directly implemented on a raw input. It is weak to encode contextual features and semantic dependencies of a relation instance. In this paper, we designed a cueing strategy which implants task specific cues into the input. It controls the attention of prompt tuning, which enable PLMs to learn task specific contextual features and semantic dependencies of a relation instance.

Inferring Commonsense Explanations as Prompts for Future Event Generation,"Future Event Generation (FEG) aims to generate fluent and reasonable future event descriptions given preceding events. It requires not only fluent text generation but also commonsense reasoning to maintain the coherence of the entire event story. However, existing FEG methods are easily trapped into repeated or general events without imposing any logical constraint to the generation process. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable FEG framework that consists of a commonsense inference model (\textsc{Im}) and an event generation model (\textsc{Gm}). The \textsc{Im}, which is pre-trained on a commonsense knowledge graph ATOMIC, learns to interpret the preceding events and conducts commonsense reasoning to reveal the character’s psychology such as intent, reaction and needs as latent variables. The \textsc{Gm} further takes the commonsense knowledge as prompts to guide and enforce the generation of logistically coherent future events. As a unique merit, the commonsense prompts can be further decoded into textual descriptions, yielding explanations for the future event. Automatic and human evaluation demonstrate that our approach can generate more coherent, specific, and logical future events than the strong baselines.

Our algorithm, which we call MAD (on account of using the mean absolute deviation in the importance weighting calculation), has distributed data generators sampling multiple candidates per source sentence on worker nodes, while a central learner updates the policy. MAD depends crucially on two variance reduction strategies: (1) a new robust importance weighting scheme that encourages learning from examples that are not too likely or unlikely relative to the current policy and (2) by learning from balanced numbers of high- and low-reward training examples. Finally, our algorithm has few hyperparameters, making it easy to use on new tasks with little or no adaptation. Experiments on a variety of tasks show the translation policies learned with MAD perform very well with both greedy decoding and beam search, and the learned policies are sensitive to the specific reward used during training.",november,True,24.809853425193896,3.449135820002835

Through self-training and co-training with the two classifiers, we show that the interplay between them helps improve the accuracy of both, and as a result, effectively parse. A seed bootstrapping technique prepares the data to train these classifiers. Our analyses further validate that such an approach in conjunction with weak supervision using prior branching knowledge of a known language (left/right-branching) and minimal heuristics injects strong inductive bias into the parser, achieving 63.1 F$_1$ on the English (PTB) test set. In addition, we show the effectiveness of our architecture by evaluating on treebanks for Chinese (CTB) and Japanese (KTB) and achieve new state-of-the-art results.\footnote{For code or data, please contact the authors.}",november,True,29.095339944725534,8.345747100559443

cpMUiyD9EA,HADE: Hierarchical Affective Dialog Encoder for Personality Recognition in Conversation,"Personality recognition in conversation aims to determine the personality traits of speakers through the dialogue content, which is of great importance in designing personalized conversational AI. Existing methods that use only linguistic patterns in utterances limit their performance. To fill in the gap, we investigate the effectiveness of incorporating affective information and modeling the interactions among speakers in conversations for personality recognition. However, available corpus with personality and explicit affective annotations is rare. Besides, modeling the dialog flow with multiple speakers is difficult. Faced with the issues, we proposed Hierarchical Affective Dialog Encoder (HADE) for effective personality recognition in conversation. HADE utilizes manual annotated Valance-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) vectors of single words and implicitly extracts affective information from utterances. Then, it introduces a hierarchical architecture with the dialog state embeddings to identify the speakers and encode the whole dialog flow. Finally, the affective information is integrated by an auxiliary VAD regression task to enhance personality recognition. Extensive experiments on a well-known dataset, \textbf{FriendsPersona}, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art models. Besides, we conduct an ablation study to discuss different approaches for integrating affective information and dialog flow modeling; the design of both parts in HADE is also verified to be effective for personality recognition in conversation.",november,True,-17.831991405234568,16.036708585390173

Moreover, we introduce a pilot update mechanism to improve the alignment between the inner-learner and meta-learner in meta learning algorithms that focus on an improved inner-learner.

Similar attempts have been made on named entity recognition (NER) which manually design templates to predict entity types for every text span in a sentence. However, such methods may suffer from error propagation induced by entity span detection, high cost due to enumeration of all possible text spans, and omission of inter-dependencies among token labels in a sentence. Here we present a simple demonstration-based learning method for NER, which lets the input be prefaced by task demonstrations for in-context learning. We perform a systematic study on demonstration strategy regarding what to include (entity examples, with or without surrounding context), how to select the examples, and what templates to use. Results on in-domain learning and domain adaptation show that the model's performance in low-resource settings can be largely improved with a suitable demonstration strategy (e.g., a 4-17% improvement on 25 train instances). We also find that good demonstration can save many labeled examples and consistency in demonstration contributes to better performance.",november,True,8.954118359056322,3.576971503451545

By simulating the process, this paper proposes a conversation-based VQA (Co-VQA) framework, which consists of three components: Questioner, Oracle, and Answerer. Questioner raises the sub questions using an extending HRED model, and Oracle answers them one-by-one.  An Adaptive Chain Visual Reasoning Model (ACVRM) for Answerer is also proposed, where the question-answer pair is used to update the visual representation sequentially. To perform supervised learning for each model, we introduce a well-designed method to build a SQS for each question on VQA 2.0 and VQA-CP v2 datasets.

However, we do not yet know how best to select passages to collect a variety of challenging examples. In this study, we crowdsource multiple-choice reading comprehension questions for passages taken from seven qualitatively distinct sources, analyzing what attributes of passages contribute to the difficulty and question types of the collected examples. To our surprise, we find that passage source, length, and readability measures do not significantly affect question difficulty. Through our manual annotation of seven reasoning types, we observe several trends between passage sources and reasoning types, e.g., logical reasoning is more often required in questions written for technical passages. These results suggest that when creating a new benchmark dataset, selecting a diverse set of passages can help ensure a diverse range of question types, but that passage difficulty need not be a priority.",november,True,2.253321458693087,11.84103707113692

In this work, we empirically find evidence indicating that the adaptations of PLMs to various few-shot tasks can be reparameterized as optimizing only a few free parameters in a unified low-dimensional intrinsic task subspace, which may help us understand why PLMs could easily adapt to various NLP tasks with small-scale data. To find such a subspace and examine its universality, we propose an analysis pipeline called intrinsic prompt tuning (IPT). Specifically, we resort to the recent success of prompt tuning and decompose the soft prompts of multiple NLP tasks into the same low-dimensional nonlinear subspace, then we learn to adapt the PLM to unseen data or tasks by only tuning parameters in this subspace. In the experiments, we study diverse few-shot NLP tasks and surprisingly find that in a 5-dimensional subspace found with 100 tasks, by only tuning 5 free parameters, we can recover 87% and 65% of the full prompt tuning performance for 100 seen tasks (using different training data) and 20 unseen tasks, respectively, showing great generalization ability of the found intrinsic task subspace.

We introduce a new Graph Convolutional LSTM (GC-LSTM) encoder to learn the semantics contained in the dialogue dependency graph by incorporating a powerful graph convolutional operator. Our proposed GC-LSTM can not only capture the spatio-temporal semantic features in a dialogue, but also learn the co-occurrence relationship between intent detection and slot filling. Furthermore, a LSTM decoder is utilized to perform final decoding of both slot filling and intent detection, which mutually improves both tasks through global optimization.

Although pretrained language models (PLMs) succeed in many NLP tasks, they are shown to be ineffective in spatial commonsense reasoning.  Starting from the observation that images are more likely to exhibit spatial commonsense than texts, we explore whether models with visual signals learn more spatial commonsense than text-based PLMs. We propose a spatial commonsense benchmark that focuses on the relative scales of objects, and the positional relationship between people and objects under different actions. We probe PLMs and models with visual signals, including vision-language pretrained models and image synthesis models, on this benchmark, and find that image synthesis models are more capable of learning accurate and consistent spatial knowledge than other models.

0n-fDxhaAHj,Cost-Effective Training in Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,"While Active Learning (AL) techniques are explored in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), only a few works focus on tackling low annotation budgets where a limited number of sentences can get translated. Such situations are especially challenging and can occur for endangered languages with few human annotators or having cost constraints to label large amounts of data. Although AL is shown to be helpful with large budgets, it is not enough to build high-quality translation systems in these low-resource conditions. In this work, we propose a cost-effective training procedure to increase the performance of NMT models utilizing a small number of annotated sentences and dictionary entries. Our method leverages monolingual data with self-supervised objectives and a small-scale, inexpensive dictionary for additional supervision to initialize the NMT model before applying AL. We show that improving the model using a combination of these knowledge sources is essential to exploit AL strategies and increase gains in low-resource conditions.

7uE-SSLTgxw,MarkBERT: Marking Word Boundaries Improves Chinese BERT,"We present a Chinese BERT model dubbed MarkBERT that uses word information in this work. Existing word-based BERT models regard words as basic units, however, due to the vocabulary limit of BERT, they only cover high-frequency words and fall back to character level when encountering out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Different from existing works, MarkBERT keeps the vocabulary being Chinese characters and inserts boundary markers between contiguous words.  Such design enables the model to handle any words in the same way, no matter they are OOV words or not. Besides, our model has two additional benefits: first, it is convenient to add word-level learning objectives over markers, which is complementary to traditional character and sentence-level pretraining tasks; second, it can easily incorporate richer semantics such as POS tags of words by replacing generic markers with POS tag-specific markers. MarkBERT pushes the state-of-the-art of Chinese named entity recognition from 95.4\% to 96.5\% on the MSRA dataset and from 82.8\% to 84.2\% on the OntoNotes dataset, respectively. Compared to previous word-based BERT models, MarkBERT achieves better accuracy on text classification, keyword recognition, and semantic similarity tasks.\footnote{All the codes and models will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/}}",november,True,-14.55078136955675,-23.171398699325817
nDqz4iCHWJq,Combating Spurious Features by Distribution Difference Regularization,"Prior studies show that spurious features are inevitable to avoid in the data collection process. These spurious features cause a shortcut for a model making bad prediction in real world test data due to ignoring the real features. In this work, we focus ondesigning a learning scheme to hinder the model from leveraging spurious features. To achieve this, prior studies usually make strong assumptions about the spurious features and identify them purely by manipulating the training data. In contrast, we make weaker assumptions and purpose a new framework for combating spurious features by observing the distribution shift between training and auxiliary data. In particular, with the help of unlabeled auxiliary data, we design a regularization technique based on the embedding distribution difference between training and auxiliary data to mitigate the effect of spurious features. Experimental results on NLI and coreference resolution tasks demonstrate that we improve the models on out-of-domain test data and reduce the contribution of spurious features in model predictions.",november,True,6.463871722325161,-8.53911820769349

nZdr6_UDzW,Mitigating Gender Bias in Machine Translation through Adversarial Learning,"Machine translation and other NLP systems often contain significant biases regarding sensitive attributes, such as gender or race, that worsen system performance and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Recent preliminary research suggests that adversarial learning can be used as part of a model-agnostic bias mitigation method that requires no data modifications. However, adapting this strategy for machine translation and other modern NLP domains requires (1) restructuring training objectives in the context of fine-tuning pretrained large language models and (2) developing measures for gender or other protected variables for tasks in which these attributes must be deduced from the data itself.  We present an adversarial learning framework that addresses these challenges to mitigate gender bias in seq2seq machine translation. Our framework improves the disparity in translation quality for sentences with male vs. female entities by 86% for English-German translation and 91% for English-French translation, with minimal effect on translation quality. The results suggest that adversarial learning is a promising technique for mitigating gender bias in machine translation.",november,True,12.03206046818754,-13.376482769315185
bmF2qC-CUG,Semantic Role Labeling as Dependency Parsing: Exploring Latent Tree Structures Inside Arguments,"Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a fundamental yet challenging task in the NLP community. Recent works of SRL mainly fall into two lines: 1) BIO-based; 2) span-based. Despite ubiquity, they share some intrinsic drawbacks of not explicitly considering internal argument structures, which may potentially hinder the model's expressiveness. To remedy this, we propose to reduce SRL to a dependency parsing task and regard the flat argument spans as latent subtrees. In particular, we equip our formulation with a novel span-constrained TreeCRF to make tree structures span-aware, and further extend it to the second-order case. Experiments on CoNLL05 and CoNLL12 benchmarks reveal that the results of our methods outperform all previous works and achieve the state-of-the-art.",november,True,-20.149153479572185,-4.551993791900048

Our main goal is to understand how humans organize information to craft complex answers. We develop an ontology of sentence-level functional roles for long form answers, and annotate 3.3k sentences in 542 examples. Our annotated data enables training a reliable role classifier that can be used for automatic analysis and thus reveals machine generated answers are structured worse than human written answers. Our data further yields an extractive summarization dataset for long form answers, giving models the ability to identify a concise answer to a complex query.

YZJl7bQkPAo,Identifying Corporate Credit Risk Sentiments from Financial News,"Credit risk management is one major practice for financial institutions, that helps them measure and understand the inherent risk within their portfolios. Historically, they relied on the assessment of default probabilities (via structural or default intensity models) and used the press as one tool to gather insights on the latest credit event developments of an entity. However, because the current news volume and coverage for companies is generally heavy, analyzing news manually by financial experts is considered a highly laborious task. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning-powered approach to automate news analysis and credit adverse events detection, with the aim of scoring the credit sentiment associated with a company in order to assist credit risk management efficiently. The result is a complete system leveraging news extraction and data enrichment (with targeted sentiment entity recognition to detect companies and text classification to identify credit events), as well as a custom scoring mechanism designed to provide the company's credit sentiment, called Credit Sentiment Score™ (CSS). Additionally, studies are shown to illustrate how CSS helps to gain knowledge about the company's credit profile but also discriminates between defaulters and non-defaulters.

However, it is still unclear why models are less robust to some perturbations than others. In this work, we test the hypothesis that the extent to which a model is affected by an unseen textual perturbation (robustness) can be explained by the learnability of the perturbation (defined as how well the model learns to identify the perturbation with a small amount of evidence). We further give a causal justification for the learnability metric. We conduct extensive experiments with four prominent NLP models --- TextRNN, BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet --- over eight types of textual perturbations on three datasets. We show that a model which is better at identifying a perturbation (higher learnability) becomes worse at ignoring such a perturbation at test time (lower robustness), providing empirical support for our hypothesis.",november,True,-4.0323758126946725,-10.595837305539634

Such models include neural-net language models, but not n-gram language models or, indeed, tokenizers, the topic of this work. Training a tokenizer normally requires access to the training data. An alternative is to train the tokenizer on publicly available data, but this, we show, degrades accuracy for a next-word prediction task by 10-20% across different datasets and models. We propose to take a tokenizer built on public data, use it to train a language model with PFL, and sample from the language model to find a new tokenizer. Retraining with the new tokenizer brings performance to within 2\,\% of the oracle tokenizer, without expending additional privacy budget.

Most existing methods avoid learning such phenomena through introducing the external information, reconstructing the optimization function or manipulating data samples. However, avoiding confronting such challenges ignores valuable information in these responses, and the dialogue models cannot learn the nature of such phenomena. In this paper, we propose a Sentence Semantic Segmentation guided Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (SegCVAE) to directly learn one-to-many and many-to-one responses. SegCVAE uses prominent semantics to replace the original semantics to learn the distribution of latent variables, which avoids the gap between latent variables and the context, thus ensuring the relevance and coherence of the generated responses. Furthermore, SegCVAE can segment multiple prominent semantics to ensure the diversity of generated responses. To evaluate the model, we first define two new tasks named one-to-many dialogue learning task and many-to-one dialogue learning task. And then provide two new dialogue datasets named One-to-Many and Many-to-One, which are extracted from the well-established dataset. Finally, we also propose the evaluation strategies based on some commonly-used metrics.

Moreover, in experiments on TIMIT and Mboshi benchmarks, our approach consistently learns a better phoneme-level representation and achieves a lower error rate in a zero-resource phoneme recognition task than previous state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning algorithms.

Instead, we head back to the original transformer model with document-level training and hope to answer the following question: Is the capacity of current models strong enough for document-level NMT? Interestingly, we observe that the original transformer with appropriate training techniques can achieve strong results for document translation, even with a length of 2000 words. We evaluate this model and several recent approaches on nine document-level datasets and two sentence-level datasets across six languages.

Minuting is a rather unstructured writing activity and is affected by who is taking the minutes and for whom the intended minutes are. With the rise of online meetings, automatic minuting would be an important benefit for the meeting participants as well as for those who might have missed the meeting. However, automatically generating meeting minutes is a challenging problem due to a variety of factors including the quality of automatic speech recorders (ASRs), availability of public meeting data, subjective knowledge of the minuter, etc. In this work, we present the first of its kind dataset on Automatic Minuting. We develop a dataset of English and Czech technical project meetings which consists of transcripts generated from ASRs, manually corrected, and minuted by several annotators. Our dataset, AutoMin, consists of 113 (English) and 53 (Czech) meetings, covering more than 160 hours of meeting content. The meeting sessions are recorded, automatically transcribed, corrected, equipped with human-generated minutes, and finally de-identified. We would publicly release (aaa.bbb.ccc) the dataset as a set of meeting transcripts and minutes, excluding the recordings for privacy reasons.  A unique feature of our dataset is that most meetings are equipped with more than one minute, each created independently. Our corpus thus allows studying differences in what people find important while taking the minutes. We also provide baseline experiments for the community to explore this novel problem further. To the best of our knowledge AutoMin is probably the first resource on minuting in English and also in a language other than English (Czech).",november,True,-5.683853730822597,18.19981759916952

A successful approach to generate new samples is to fine-tune a pretrained LM on the task-specific data and then sample from the label-conditioned LM. However, fine-tuning can be difficult when task-specific data is scarce. In this work, we explore whether large pretrained LMs can be used to generate new useful samples without fine-tuning. For a given class, we propose concatenating few examples and prompt them to GPT-3 to generate new examples. We evaluate this method for few-shot intent classification on CLINC150 and SNIPS and find that data generated by GPT-3 greatly improves the performance of the intent classifiers. Importantly, we find that, without any LM fine-tuning, the gains brought by data augmentation with GPT-3 are similar to those reported in prior work on LM-based data augmentation.

A Reliable Evaluation and a Reasonable Approach,"In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been shown to capture factual knowledge from massive texts, which encourages the proposal of PLM-based knowledge graph completion (KGC) models. However, these models are still quite behind the SOTA KGC models in terms of performance. In this work, we find two main reasons for the weak performance: (1) Inaccurate evaluation setting. The evaluation setting under the closed-world assumption (CWA) may underestimate the PLM-based KGC models since they introduce more external knowledge; (2) Inappropriate utilization of PLMs. Most PLM-based KGC models simply splice the labels of entities and relations as inputs, leading to incoherent sentences that do not take full advantage of the implicit knowledge in PLMs. To alleviate these problems, we highlight a more accurate evaluation setting under the open-world assumption (OWA), which manual checks the correctness of knowledge that is not in KGs. Moreover, motivated by prompt tuning, we propose a novel PLM-based KGC model named PKGC. The basic idea is to convert each triple and its support information into natural prompt sentences, which is further fed into PLMs for classification. Experiment results on two KGC datasets demonstrate OWA is more reliable for evaluating KGC, especially on the link prediction, and the effectiveness of our PKCG model on both CWA and OWA settings.",november,True,-9.51297399536502,-20.490178697306412

Using this strategy, we can train and apply the models on a single GPU. While the end-to-end models show superior translation performance to cascaded ones, the application of this technology has a limitation on the need for additional end-to-end training data.

Two reasons have made ECPE a more challenging, but more applicable task in real world scenarios: 1) an ECPE model needs to identify both emotions and their corresponding causes without the annotation of emotions. 2) the ECPE task involves finding causes for multiple emotions in the document context, while ECE is for one emotion. However, most existing methods for ECPE adopt an unified approach that models emotion extraction and cause extraction jointly through shared contextual representations, which is suboptimal in extracting multiple emotion-cause pairs. In addition, previous ECPE works are evaluated on one ECE dataset, which exhibits a bias that majority of documents have only one emotion-cause pair. In this work, we propose a simple pipelined approach that builds on two independent encoders, in which the emotion extraction model only provide input features for the cause extraction model. We reconstruct the benchmark dataset to better meet ECPE settings.

Current state-of-the-art Financial Sentiment Analysis (FSA) models, however, have overlooked the importance of external knowledge. To fill this gap, we propose using attentive CNN and LSTM to strategically integrate multiple external knowledge sources into the pre-trained language model fine-tuning process for TABFSA. Experiments on the FiQA Task 1 and SemEval 2017 Task 5 datasets show that the knowledge-enabled models systematically improve upon their plain deep learning counterparts, and some outperform the state-of-the-art results reported in terms of aspect sentiment analysis error.",november,True,-24.513252875652302,24.03578205900772

pc04S6OK8To,A Multi-Document Coverage Reward for RELAXed Multi-Document Summarization,"Multi-document summarization (MDS) has made significant progress in recent years, in part facilitated by the availability of new, dedicated datasets and capacious language models. However, a standing limitation of these models is that they are trained against limited references and with plain maximum-likelihood objectives. As for many other generative tasks, reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential to improve the training of MDS models; yet, it requires a carefully-designed reward that can ensure appropriate leverage of both the reference summaries and the input documents. For this reason, in this paper we propose fine-tuning an MDS baseline with a reward that balances a reference-based metric such as ROUGE with coverage of the input documents. To implement the approach, we utilize RELAX (Grathwohl et al., 2018), a contemporary gradient estimator which is both low-variance and unbiased, and we fine-tune the baseline in a few-shot style for both stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results over the Multi-News and WCEP MDS datasets show significant improvements of up to +0.95 pp average ROUGE score and +3.17 pp METEOR score over the baseline, and competitive results with the literature. In addition, they show that the coverage of the input documents is increased, and evenly across all documents.",november,True,11.39462623786174,26.34075055560857

BgUXvB7hn1t,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Event Detection via Meta Self-Paced Learning,"As important events in textual data are usually highly specific in terms of tasks and domains, a change in data distribution would have a significant impact on detection performance. Recent methods addressing unsupervised domain adaptation for event detection task typically extracted domain-invariant representations through combining and balancing various objectives to align the feature space between source and target domains. While effective, these methods are impractical as large-scale language models are drastically growing bigger to achieve optimal performance. To this end, we propose Meta Self-Paced Domain Adaption framework (MSP-DA) that effectively and efficiently alleviates the need for domain-specific hyperparameter tuning. By imitating the train-test dataset split based on the difficulties of source domain's samples, the model is trained through a meta-learning process that learns to weigh the importance of each labeled instance and to balance every alignment objective, simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework substantially improves performance on target domains, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

wsyxNOwWtoq,Teaching BERT to Wait: Balancing Accuracy and Latency for Streaming Disfluency Detection,"In modern interactive speech-based systems speech is consumed and transcribed incrementally prior to having disfluencies removed. While this post-processing step is crucial for producing clean transcripts and high performance on downstream tasks (e.g. machine translation), most current state-of-the-art NLP models such as the Transformer operate non-incrementally, potentially causing unacceptable delays for the user. In this work we propose a streaming BERT-based sequence tagging model that, combined with a novel training objective, is capable of detecting disfluencies in real-time while balancing accuracy and latency. This is accomplished by training the model to decide whether to immediately output a prediction for the current input or to wait for further context, in essence learning to dynamically size the lookahead window. Our results demonstrate that our model produces comparably accurate predictions and does so sooner than our baselines, with lower flicker. Furthermore, the model attains state-of-the-art latency and stability scores when compared with recent work on incremental disfluency detection.",november,True,20.888480805769984,-17.42614212822213

Researchers explore more on visual dialogue tasks in such kind of single- or perfectly co-observable visual scene, while somewhat neglect the exploration on tasks of non-perfectly co-observable visual scene, where the images accessed by two agents may not be exactly the same, often occurred in practice. Although building common ground in non-perfectly co-observable visual scene through conversation is significant for advanced dialogue agents, the lack of such dialogue task and corresponding large-scale dataset makes it impossible to carry out in-depth research. To break this limitation, we propose an object-referring game in non-perfectly co-observable visual scene, where the goal is to spot the difference between the similar visual scenes through conversing in natural language. The task addresses challenges of the dialogue strategy in non-perfectly co-observable visual scene and the ability of categorizing objects. Correspondingly, we construct a large-scale multi-modal dataset, named \textit{SpotDiff}, which contains 49k Virtual Reality images and 97k dialogues generated by self-play.

We formulate a generative model of action sequences in which goals generate sequences of high-level subtask descriptions, and these descriptions generate sequences of low-level actions. We describe how to train this model using primarily unannotated demonstrations by parsing demonstrations into sequences of named high-level subtasks, using only a small number of seed annotations to ground language in action. In trained models, the space of natural language commands indexes a combinatorial library of skills; agents can use these skills to plan by generating high-level instruction sequences tailored to novel goals. We evaluate this approach in the ALFRED household simulation environment, providing natural language annotations for only 10% of demonstrations.

This shortcoming does not only lead to errors that can seriously distort the meaning of the input, but also hinders the adoption of such systems in application scenarios (like computer-assisted interpreting) where the translation of named entities, like person names, is crucial. In this paper, we first analyse the outputs of ASR/ST systems to identify the reasons of failures in person name transcription/translation. Besides the frequency in the training data, we pinpoint the nationality of the referred person as a key factor. We then mitigate the problem by creating multilingual models, and further improve our ST systems by forcing them to jointly generate transcripts and translations, prioritising the former over the latter. Overall, our solutions result in a relative improvement in token-level person name accuracy by 47.8% on average for three language pairs (en$\rightarrow$es,fr,it).",november,True,17.96859936469858,-22.723716914484164

On seven well-known text-to-SQL datasets including multi-domain, multi-table and multi-turn, UniSAr demonstrates highly comparable or better performance to the most advanced specifically-designed text-to-SQL models.

However, the unsupervised sub-word tokenization methods commonly used in these models (e.g., byte-pair encoding - BPE) are sub-optimal at handling morphologically rich languages. Even given a morphological analyzer, naive sequencing of morphemes into a standard BERT architecture is inefficient at capturing morphological compositionality and expressing word-relative syntactic regularities. We address these challenges by proposing a simple two-tier BERT architecture that leverages a morphological analyzer and explicitly represents morphological compositionality. Despite the success of BERT, most of its evaluations have been conducted on high-resource languages, obscuring its applicability on low-resource languages. We evaluate our proposed method on the low-resource morphologically rich Kinyarwanda language, naming the proposed model architecture KinyaBERT. A robust set of experimental results reveal that KinyaBERT outperforms solid baselines by 2% F1 score on a named entity recognition task and by 4.3% average score of a machine-translated GLUE benchmark.

Such protocols overlook key features of grammatical gender languages, which are characterized by morphosyntactic chains of gender agreement, marked on a variety of lexical items and parts-of-speech (POS). To overcome this limitation, we enrich the natural, gender-sensitive MuST-SHE corpus with two new annotation layers: POS and agreement chains.

However, currently the performance of discourse models is very low on texts outside of the training distribution's coverage. There is need for a measure that can inform us to what extent our model generalizes from the training to the test sample when these samples may be drawn from distinct distributions. While this can be estimated via distribution shift, we argue that this does not directly correlate with change in the observed error of a classifier (i.e. error-gap). Thus, we propose to use a statistic from the theoretical domain adaptation literature which can be directly tied to error-gap. We study the bias of this statistic as an estimator of error-gap both theoretically and through a large-scale empirical study of over 2400 experiments on 6 discourse datasets from domains including, but not limited to: news, biomedical texts, TED talks, Reddit posts, and fiction. Our results not only motivate our proposal and help us to understand its limitations, but also provide insight on the properties of discourse models and datasets which improve performance in domain adaptation. For instance, we find that non-news datasets are slightly easier to transfer to than news datasets when the training and test sets are very different.

NEvmCSnnj63,Achieving Conversational Goals with Unsupervised Post-hoc Knowledge Injection,"A limitation of current neural dialog models is that they tend to suffer from a lack of specificity and informativeness in generated responses, primarily due to dependence on training data that covers a limited variety of scenarios and conveys limited knowledge. One way to alleviate this issue is to extract relevant knowledge from external sources at decoding time and incorporate it into the dialog response. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc knowledge-injection technique where we first retrieve a diverse set of relevant knowledge snippets conditioned on both the dialog history and an initial response from an existing dialog model. We construct multiple candidate responses, individually injecting each retrieved snippet into the initial response using a gradient-based decoding method, and then select the final response with an unsupervised ranking step. Our experiments in goal-oriented and knowledge-grounded dialog settings demonstrate that human annotators judge the outputs from the proposed method to be more engaging and informative compared to responses from prior dialog systems. We further show that knowledge-augmentation promotes success in achieving conversational goals in both experimental settings.",november,True,-12.559115798759816,8.119859659321724
3BdPjeRA1dz,Semi-supervised New Event Type Induction and Description via Contrastive Loss-Enforced Batch Attention,"Most event extraction methods have traditionally relied on an annotated set of event types. However, creating event ontologies and annotating supervised training data are expensive and time-consuming. Previous work has proposed semi-supervised approaches which leverage seen (annotated) types to learn how to automatically discover new event types. State-of-the-art methods, both semi-supervised or fully unsupervised, use a form of reconstruction loss on specific tokens in a context. In contrast, we present a novel approach to semi-supervised new event type induction using a masked contrastive loss which learns similarities between event mentions by enforcing an attention mechanism over the data minibatch. We further disentangle the discovered clusters by approximating the underlying manifolds in the data, which allows us to increase normalized mutual information and Fowlkes-Mallows scores by over 20% absolute. Building on these clustering results, we extend our approach to two new tasks: predicting the type name of the discovered clusters and linking them to FrameNet frames.",november,True,-15.517833773379195,33.577396736648396

LVqYNHP5tia,Table-based Fact Verification with Self-adaptive Mixture of Experts,"The table-based fact verification task has recently gained widespread attention and yet remains to be a very challenging problem. It inherently requires informative reasoning over natural language together with different numerical and logical reasoning on tables (e.g., count, superlative, comparative). In this paper, we present a Self-adaptive Mixture-of-Experts Network (SaMoE), a novel framework built on this fundamental property. Specifically, we have developed a mixture-of-experts neural network to recognize and execute different types of reasoning---the network is composed of multiple experts, each handling a specific part of the semantics for reasoning, whereas a management module is applied to decide the contribution of each expert network to the verification result. A self-adaptive method is developed to teach the management module combining results of different experts more efficiently without external knowledge. The experimental results illustrate that our framework achieves 85.1% accuracy on the benchmark dataset TabFact, comparable with the previous state-of-the-art models. We hope our framework can serve as a new baseline for table-based verification. Our code will be available at (URL to be released here).",november,True,3.0063286647113046,35.85051451548975

We point out that existing learning-to-route MoE methods suffer from the routing fluctuation issue, i.e., the target expert of the same input may change along with training, but only one expert will be activated for the input during inference. The routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input updates different experts but only one is finally used. In this paper, we propose StableMoE with two training stages to address the routing fluctuation problem. In the first training stage, we learn a balanced and cohesive routing strategy and distill it into a lightweight router decoupled from the backbone model. In the second training stage, we utilize the distilled router to determine the token-to-expert assignment and freeze it for a stable routing strategy. We validate our method on language modeling and multilingual machine translation. The results show that StableMoE outperforms existing MoE methods in terms of both convergence speed and performance.",november,True,16.037966124055956,-10.580259214076351

These training settings expose the encoder and the decoder in a machine translation model with different data distributions. In this paper, we examine how different varieties of multilingual training contribute to learning these two components of the MT model. Specifically, we compare bilingual models with encoders and/or decoders initialized by multilingual training. We show that multilingual training is beneficial to encoders in general, while it only benefits decoders for low-resource languages (LRLs). We further find the important attention heads for each language pair and compare their correlations during inference. Our analysis sheds light on how multilingual translation models work and also enables us to propose methods to improve performance by training with highly related languages. Our many-to-one models for high-resource languages and one-to-many models for LRL outperform the best results reported by Aharoni et al. (2019).",november,True,13.6405638463627,-25.971228093306667

Specifically, we propose a verbalizer-retriever-reader framework for ODQA over data and text where verbalized tables from Wikipedia and graphs from Wikidata are used as augmented knowledge sources. We show that our Unified Data and Text QA, UDT-QA. can effectively benefit from the expanded knowledge index, leading to large gains over text-only baselines.

CARP utilizes hybrid chain to model the explicit intermediate reasoning process across table and text for question answering. We also propose a novel chain-centric pre-training method, to enhance the pre-trained model in identifying the cross-modality reasoning process and alleviating the data sparsity problem. This method constructs the large-scale reasoning corpus by synthesizing pseudo heterogeneous reasoning paths from Wikipedia and generating corresponding questions. We evaluate our system on OTT-QA, a large-scale table-and-text open-domain question answering benchmark, and our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

5vyiWHwpflJ,Tokenization on the Number Line is All You Need,"Despite the recent breakthroughs in language modeling, their ability to represent numbers is insufficient. Subword tokenization, the standard choice for number representation, breaks down a number into arbitrary chunks thereby failing to explicitly capture the relationship between two numbers on on the number-line. To alleviate this shortcoming, alternate approaches have been proposed that modify numbers at various stages of the language modeling pipeline. These methods can be broadly classified into three categories that make changes to a) the notation (\eg scientific vs decimal) b) vocabulary (\eg introduce a new token for numbers in range $10-100$) and c) architectural changes to directly regress to a desired number. The contributions of this work are three fold -- firstly, we propose vocabulary level changes in the decoding stage and study its behavior. Next, we study the performance of both the proposed approach and existing number representation schemes in the context of masked number presentation. We find that a carefully designed tokenization scheme is both the simplest to implement and sufficient \ie with similar performance to the state-of-the-art approach that requires making significant architectural changes. Finally, we evaluate the various number representation schemes on the downstream task of numerical fact estimation (for fermi problems) in a zero-shot setting and find similar trends \ie changes at the tokenization level achieve near state-of-the-art results while requiring minimal resources compared to other number representation schemes.",november,True,1.5550997863728802,-27.628683370797063

It has been argued that to accomplish this, models need some form of grounding, i.e., connection, to objects and how they interact in the physical world. Inspired by the way humans learn about the world through interaction, we develop an approach to learning physical properties directly. We introduce a dataset of 200k object interactions in a 3D virtual environment and a self-supervised pretraining objective for learning representations of these objects. We show with probing and clustering experiments that even in the zero-shot setting, derived models learn robust representations of objects and their affordances in an unsupervised manner. Our model outperforms pretrained language and vision models on an affordance prediction baseline, suggesting that pretraining on observed interactions encodes grounded information that is not readily learned in conventional text or vision models.",november,True,1.3662089478135868,9.178241136366985

To systematically audit this issue, we present a general and scalable pipeline to replace entity names with names from a variety of sources, ranging from common English names to names from other languages to arbitrary strings. Across five datasets and three pretrained model architectures, MRC models consistently perform worse when entities are renamed, with particularly large accuracy drops on datasets constructed via distant supervision. We also find large differences between models: SpanBERT, which is pretrained with span-level masking, is more robust than RoBERTa, despite having similar accuracy on unperturbed test data. We further experiment with different masking strategies as the continual pretraining objective and find that entity-based masking can improve the robustness of MRC models.",november,True,-15.846580183624312,-9.264812211423033

Then GPT-2 equipped with an action structure parser module (termed as DA-GPT-2) is applied to learn the word level DPL.

The essence of sarcasm, which is also a sufficient and necessary condition, is the conflict between literal and implied sentiments.

As a result, the recognition of sophisticated and obscure sentiment brings in a great challenge to sarcasm detection.  In this paper, we propose a dual-channel framework by modeling both literal and implied sentiment separately. Based on the flexible dual-channel framework, we design Dual-Channel Net (DC-Net) to recognize the sentiment conflict.

cbJwLMMduMs,Tell me who you are and i'll tell you what to do: A Persona Grounded Task Oriented Dialogue Generation System,"Modern dialogue agents can broadly be categorized as either chit-chat or task-oriented systems. While the purpose of a chit-chat agent is to entertain and engage the user- lubricating the conversation, so to say-, the task oriented chat-bot is dedicated to fulfilling specific requests (e.g., ticket booking). Current task-oriented agents produce precise but bland and uninteresting responses. While using such agents a user may interpose personal remarks, and the failure of the agent to process and respond to such statements could be a put-off for the user. In this paper we propose a system that is persona-specific, can handle chit-chat utterances, and produces responses that add a human element to the conversation, while always remaining grounded on the task. Since current task-oriented datasets do not have persona-profiles, and do not consist of personalized remarks in utterances, we modify an existing dataset (MultiWOZ 2.1) to suit our needs. We give a semi-automated dataset creation method that uses GPT-2 model trained on the PERSONA-CHAT dataset. A small subset of the obtained data is also manually crafted to acquire a gold standard data. Our framework is based on GPT-2, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Memory Network that is trained on this dataset to generate persona-grounded task-oriented responses. Both automatic and manual evaluation show the effectiveness of our model and dataset. Our proposed system achieves a BLEU score of 12.12 on this new dataset.

OXXX_dfeH7v,Fusing Heterogeneous Factors with Triaffine Mechanism for Nested Named Entity Recognition,"Nested entities are observed in many domains due to their compositionality, which cannot be easily recognized by the widely-used sequence labeling framework. A natural solution is to treat the task as a span classification problem. To learn better span representation and increase classification performance, it is crucial to effectively integrate heterogeneous factors including inside tokens, boundaries, labels, and related spans which could be contributing to nested entities recognition. To fuse these heterogeneous factors, we propose a novel triaffine mechanism including triaffine attention and scoring. Triaffine attention uses boundaries and labels as queries, and uses inside tokens and related spans as keys and values for span representations. Triaffine scoring interacts with boundaries and span representations for classification. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art $F_1$ scores on four nested NER datasets: ACE2004,  ACE2005, GENIA, and KBP2017.",november,True,-30.95705060155625,-4.221203658831755

uRVJ8qwi7aF,OpenKorPOS: Democratizing Korean Tokenization with Voting-Based Open Corpus Annotation,"Korean is a language with complex morphology that uses spaces at larger-than-word boundaries, unlike other East-Asian languages. While morpheme-based text generation can provide significant semantic advantages compared to commonly used character-level approaches, Korean morphological analyzers only provide a sequence of morpheme-level tokens, losing information in the tokenization process. Two crucial issues are the loss of spacing information and subcharacter level morpheme normalization, both of which make the tokenization result challenging to reconstruct the original input string, deterring the application to generative tasks. As this problem originates from the conventional scheme used when creating a POS tagging corpus, we propose an improvement to the existing scheme, which makes it friendlier to generative tasks.  On top of that, we suggest a semi-automatic annotation of a corpus by leveraging public analyzers. We vote the surface and POS from the outcome and fill the sequence with the selected morphemes, yielding tokenization with a decent quality that incorporates space information. Our scheme is verified via an evaluation done on an external corpus, and subsequently, is adopted to Korean Wikipedia to construct an open, permissive resource. We compare morphological analyzer performance trained on our corpus with existing methods, then perform an extrinsic evaluation on a downstream task.",november,True,14.252046499736613,-36.36789695592547

However, previous end-to-end approaches do not account for the fact that some generation sub-tasks, specifically aggregation and lexicalisation, can benefit from transfer learning in different extents. To exploit these varying potentials for transfer learning, we propose a new hierarchical approach for few-shot and zero-shot generation. Our approach consists of a three-moduled jointly trained architecture: the first module independently lexicalises the distinct units of information in the input as sentence sub-units (e.g. phrases), the second module recurrently aggregates these sub-units to generate a unified intermediate output, while the third module subsequently post-edits it to generate a coherent and fluent final text. We perform extensive empirical analysis and ablation studies on few-shot and zero-shot settings across 4 datasets. Automatic and human evaluation shows that the proposed hierarchical approach is consistently capable of achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous work.",november,True,8.991588469682366,-18.529380065880574

Recent NTMs have been applied to many applications and shown promising improvement on text analysis. However, they mainly focus on word-occurrences and are often optimized by maximizing the likelihood-based objective, which could lead to suboptimal topic coherence and document representation. To overcome the above bottleneck, we introduce an additional contrastive loss that pushes the topical representation of a document learned by an NTM close to the semantic representation of the document obtained from pre-trained language models. In this way, the prior knowledge of the pre-trained language models can enrich the contextual information of the target corpus for NTMs. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

A Data-driven, Multilingual Exploration","Although proper handling of discourse phenomena significantly contributes to the quality of machine translation (MT), improvements on these phenomena are not adequately measured in common translation quality metrics. Recent works in context-aware MT attempt to target a small set of these phenomena during evaluation. In this paper, we propose a methodology to identify translations that require context systematically, and use this methodology to both confirm the difficulty of previously studied phenomena as well as uncover new ones that have not been addressed in previous work. We then develop the \textbf{Mu}ltilingual \textbf{D}iscourse-\textbf{A}ware (MuDA) benchmark, a series of taggers for these phenomena in 14 different language pairs, which we use to evaluate context-aware MT. We find that state-of-the-art context-aware MT models make marginal improvements over context-agnostic models, which suggests current models do not handle these ambiguities effectively. We will release code and data to invite the MT research community to increase efforts on context-aware translation on discourse phenomena and languages that are currently overlooked.",november,True,22.60163625359578,-22.97403037211231

xHBcjbi8ifL,RepAL: A Simple and Plug-and-play Method for Improving Unsupervised Sentence Representations,"Unsupervised sentence representation learning is a fundamental problem in natural language processing and has been studied extensively in recent years. This paper presents Representation ALchemy (RepAL), an extremely simple post-processing method that enhances unsupervised sentence representations. The basic idea in RepAL is to extract redundant information from the representation of a sentence generated by the existing models and then refine the representation through an embedding refinement operation to filter such redundant information. In this paper, we analyze the redundant information from two levels: sentence-level and corpus-level, and the theoretical analysis for the latter is also conducted. We point out that RepAL is free of training and is a plug-and-play method that can be combined with most existing unsupervised sentence learning models. Extensive experiments demonstrate RepAL’s effectiveness and show that RepAL is a model-agnostic method for unsupervised sentence embedding enhancement. Besides, we also designed detailed ablation studies to understand why RepAL works and provided in-depth analysis and understanding of the redundant information.",november,True,8.624042453597026,-3.387893896893335

However, there is no study to resolve this problem by improving the model structure. We enforced the causal independence	 mechanism in the self-attention network, which constrains attention mapping topologies (AMGs) as causal structures. To implement it, we defined a smooth loss on the Markov boundary constrained directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the Lagrange duality, and used it to optimize the AMGs towards causal structures. Further, this causal attention network was applied on Transformer (Causal Transformer).

Recently, lots of deep learning models have made great progress in MWP solving on answer accuracy, they rely on shallow heuristics to achieve high performance, lacking of grounded math logic reasoning, which makes them uninterpretable. To address this issue and push the research boundary of MWPs to interpretable MWP solving, we construct a large-scale and high-quality MWP dataset named InterMWP which consists of 11507 MWP data and annotates interpretable algebraic knowledge formulas as the grounded linguistic logic of each solving equation and asks for a solver to output the formulas when it decides current predicted node is a inner-node (operator) during expression reasoning. We further propose a strong baseline called InterSolver to show the effectiveness of our constructed dataset and show how to harvest these logic knowledge by fusing logic knowledge with semantic representation to improve problem solving and make a step towards providing interpretability. Experimental results shows that our InterSolver has strong logical formula-based interpretability while achieving high answer accuracy simultaneously.

At inference time, instead of the standard Gaussian distribution used by VAE, CUC-VAE allows sampling from an utterance-specific prior distribution conditioned on cross-utterance information, which allows the prosody features generated by the TTS system to be related to the context and is more similar to how humans naturally produce prosody. The performance of CUC-VAE is evaluated via a qualitative listening test for naturalness, intelligibility and quantitative measurements, including word error rates and the standard deviation of prosody attributes. Experimental results on LJ-Speech and LibriTTS data show that the proposed CUC-VAE TTS system improves naturalness and prosody diversity with clear margins.

Generally, RE models for this task require labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables, these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers, captions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables. Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to improvements of 9\%-45\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular datasets. ",november,True,-26.774946396386248,8.131182574337709

Meanwhile, static word representations (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) have been shown to benefit from isotropic spaces. Therefore, previous work has developed methods to calibrate the embedding space of transformers in order to ensure isotropy. However, a recent study (Cai et al. 2021) shows that the embedding space of transformers is locally isotropic, which suggests that these models are already capable of exploiting the expressive capacity of their embedding space. In this work, we conduct an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for isotropy calibration on transformers and find that they do not provide consistent improvements across models and tasks.

Our dataset is valuable in two folds: First, with annotations on particular reading skills required for answering each question, FairytaleQA decomposes the otherwise scarce performance into multiple analysis dimensions that are consistent to human-language-learning assessment. We ran existing QA models on our dataset, and confirmed that this annotation helps assess models' fine-grained learning skills.

To address an aspect of this, we investigate the impact of injecting isotropy during training of VAEs. We achieve this by using an isotropic Gaussian posterior (IGP) instead of the ellipsoidal Gaussian posterior. We illustrate that IGP effectively encourages isotropy in the representations, inducing a more discriminative latent space. Compared to vanilla VAE, this translates into a much better classification performance, robustness to input perturbation, and generative behavior.  Additionally, we offer insights about the representational properties encouraged by IGP.",november,True,24.716859338108573,-6.630919700472647

IEcWf--zVAG,Controlling Pretrained Language Generation Models by Learning to Focus,"Transformer-based language models, which are pretrained on large-scale unsupervised data and then finetuned on task-specific datasets, have become the dominant paradigm for various natural language generation tasks. The finetuning and usages of such models are typically conducted in an end-to-end manner. This work attempts to develop a control mechanism by which a user can select spans of context as ""highlights'' for the model to focus on, while generating output text. To achieve this goal, we augment a pretrained model with trainable ""attention vectors'' that are directly applied to the model's embeddings, while the model itself is kept fixed. These vectors, trained on automatic annotations derived from attribution methods, act as indicators for context importance. We test our approach on two core generation tasks: dialogue response generation and abstractive summarization. We also collect evaluation data where the highlight-generation pairs are annotated by humans. Our experiments show that the trained attention vectors are effective in steering the model to generate outputs that are relevant to user-selected highlights.

However, different PELT methods may perform rather differently on the same task, making it nontrivial to select the most appropriate method for a specific task, especially considering the fast-growing number of new PELT methods and tasks. In light of model diversity and the difficulty of model selection, we propose a unified framework, UniPELT, which incorporates different PELT methods as submodules and learns to activate the ones that best suit the current data or task setup via gating mechanism. On the GLUE benchmark, UniPELT consistently achieves 1~4% gains compared to the best individual PELT method that it incorporates and even outperforms fine-tuning under different setups. Moreover, UniPELT generally surpasses the upper bound that takes the best performance of all its submodules used individually on each task, indicating that a mixture of multiple PELT methods may be inherently more effective than single methods.",november,True,9.090951918072943,-22.578457136878765

cnMI-mshhv5,Revisiting Softmax for Uncertainty Approximation in Text Classification,"Uncertainty approximation in text classification is an important area with applications in domain adaptation and interpretability. The most widely used uncertainty approximation method is Monte Carlo Dropout, which is computationally expensive as it requires multiple forward passes through the model. A cheaper alternative is to simply use a softmax to estimate model uncertainty. However, prior work has indicated that the softmax can generate overconfident uncertainty estimates and can thus be tricked into producing incorrect predictions. In this paper, we perform a thorough empirical analysis of both methods on three datasets with two base neural architectures in order to reveal insight into the trade-offs between the two. We compare the methods' uncertainty approximations and downstream text classification performance, while weighing their performance against their computational complexity as a cost-benefit analysis. We find that, while Monte Carlo produces the best uncertainty approximations, using a simple softmax leads to competitive F1 results for text classification at a much lower computational cost, suggesting that softmax can in fact be a sufficient uncertainty estimate when computational resources are a concern.",november,True,27.72344910696988,1.6637203482046907

In this work, we directly integrate the constraints into NMT models through vectorizing discrete constraints into continuous keys and values that can be utilized by the attention modules of NMT models.

Inspired by the text infilling task for pre-training generative models that can flexibly predict missing spans, we propose a novel generative prompt tuning method to reformulate relation classification as an infilling problem to eliminate the rigid prompt restrictions, which allows our method to process label verbalizations of varying lengths at multiple predicted positions and thus be able to fully leverage rich semantics of entity and relation labels.

KNqKOUnl_3F,MILLIE: Modular & Iterative Multilingual Open Information Extraction,"Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) is the task of extracting $(subject, predicate, object)$ triples from natural language sentences. Current OpenIE systems extract all triple slots independently. In contrast, we investigate the hypothesis that it may be beneficial to extract triple slots iteratively: first extract easy slots, followed by the difficult ones by conditioning on the easy slots, and therefore achieve a better overall extraction. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a neural OpenIE system, MILLIE, that operates in an iterative fashion.  Due to the iterative nature, the system is also modular: it is possible to seamlessly integrate rule based extraction systems with a neural end-to-end system, thereby allowing rule based systems to supply extraction slots which MILLIE can leverage for extracting the remaining slots. We confirm our hypothesis empirically: MILLIE outperforms SOTA systems on multiple languages ranging from Chinese to Arabic. Additionally, we are the first to provide an OpenIE test dataset for Arabic. ",november,True,27.70626417916685,22.290863859151774

However, vanilla fine-tuning tends to achieve degenerated and unstable results, owing to the  Language Interference among different languages, and Parameter Overload under the few-sample transfer learning scenarios. To address two problems elegantly, we propose S$^4$-Tuning, a Simple Cross-lingual Sub-network Tuning method.  S$^4$-Tuning first detects the most essential sub-network for each target language, and only updates it during fine-tuning. In this way, the language sub-networks lower the scale of trainable parameters, and hence better suit the low-resource scenarios. Meanwhile, the commonality and characteristics across languages are modeled by the overlapping and non-overlapping parts to ease the interference among languages. Simple but effective, S$^4$-Tuning gains consistent improvements over vanilla fine-tuning on three multi-lingual tasks involving 37 different languages in total (XNLI, PAWS-X, and Tatoeba).",november,True,9.327900116987202,-23.168799188663932

These errors have been studied extensively and are relatively simple for humans. Chinese Semantic Error Recognition (CSER) pays attention to more complex semantic errors that humans cannot easily recognize compared with Chinese text error detection. Considering the complex syntactic relation between words, we find that syntactic structure from the syntax tree can help identify semantic errors. In this paper, we consider adopting the pre-trained models to solve the task of CSER. To make the model learn syntactic structure in the pre-training stage, we designed a novel pre-training task to predict the syntactic structure from the syntax tree between different words. Due to the lack of a published dataset for CSER, we build a high-quality dataset for CSER for the first time named Corpus of Chinese Linguistic Semantic Acceptability (CoCLSA), which is extracted from the high school examinations.

Traditional sequence labeling framework requires extensive datasets and high-quality annotations, which are typically expensive in practice. In this paper, we aim to build an entity recognition model based on only a few shots of annotated document images. To overcome the data limitation, we propose to leverage the label surface names to better inform the model of the target entity semantics. Specifically, we go beyond sequence labeling and develop a novel label-aware seq2seq framework, LASER. We design a new labeling scheme that generates the label surface names word-by-word explicitly after generating the entities. Moreover, we design special layout identifiers to capture the spatial correspondence between regions and labels. During training, LASER refines the label semantics by updating the label surface name representations and also strengthens the label-region correlation. In this way, LASER recognizes the entities from document images through both semantic and layout correspondence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of LASER under the few-shot setting. ",november,True,-27.67832286198465,-4.057087884372602

WtK3-ws0P3_,LAGr: Label Aligned Graphs for Better Systematic Generalization in Semantic Parsing,"Semantic parsing is the task of producing structured meaning representations for natural language sentences.  Recent research has pointed out that the commonly-used sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) semantic parsers struggle to generalize systematically, i.e. to handle examples that require recombining known knowledge in novel settings. In this work, we show that better systematic generalization can be achieved by producing the meaning representation directly as a graph and not as a sequence. To this end we propose LAGr (Label Aligned Graphs), a general framework to produce semantic parses by independently predicting node and edge labels for a complete multi-layer input-aligned graph. The strongly-supervised LAGr algorithm requires aligned graphs as inputs, whereas weakly-supervised LAGr infers alignments for originally unaligned target graphs using approximate maximum-a-posteriori inference. Experiments demonstrate that LAGr achieves significant improvements in systematic generalization upon the baseline seq2seq parsers in both strongly- and weakly-supervised settings.",november,True,3.9326475721764185,6.83450543900018
CluDkNLKjO,Combining Feature and Instance Attribution to Detect Artifacts,"Training the deep neural networks that dominate NLP requires large datasets. These are often collected automatically or via crowdsourcing, and may exhibit systematic biases or annotation artifacts. By the latter we mean spurious correlations between inputs and outputs that do not represent a generally held causal relationship between features and classes; models that exploit such correlations may appear to perform a given task well, but fail on out of sample data. In this paper we evaluate use of different attribution methods for aiding identification of training data artifacts. We propose new hybrid approaches that combine saliency maps (which highlight ""important"" input features) with instance attribution methods (which retrieve training samples ""influential"" to a given prediction). We show that this proposed training-feature attribution can be used to efficiently uncover artifacts in training data when a challenging validation set is available. We also carry out a small user study to evaluate whether these methods are useful to NLP researchers in practice, with promising results. ",november,True,0.595791409221815,-7.489123779076165

We show through surveys that this is indeed the case and refer to it as the square one experimental setup. NLP research often goes beyond the square one setup, e.g, focusing not only on accuracy, but also on fairness or interpretability, but typically along a single dimension. Most work focused on multilinguality, for example, considers only accuracy; most work on fairness or interpretability considers only English; and so on. We show this through manual classification of recent NLP research papers and ACL Test-of-Time award recipients. Such one-dimensionality of most research means we are only exploring a fraction of the NLP research search space. We provide historical and recent examples of how the square one bias has led researchers to draw false conclusions or make unwise choices, point to promising yet unexplored directions on the research manifold, and make practical recommendations to enable more multi-dimensional research.",november,True,-1.6890019311714042,-9.460717961964507

We first show that the results from commonly adopted automatic metrics for text generation have little correlation with those obtained from human evaluation, which motivates us to directly utilize human evaluation results to learn the automatic evaluation model. In the experiments, we evaluate the generated texts to predict story ranks using our model as well as other reference-based and reference-free metrics. Results show that Vrank prediction is significantly more aligned to human evaluation than other metrics with almost 30\% higher accuracy when ranking story pairs. Moreover, we demonstrate that only Vrank shows human-like behavior in its strong ability to find better stories when the quality gap between two stories is high. Finally, we show the superiority of Vrank by its generalizability to pure textual stories, and conclude that this reuse of human evaluation results puts Vrank in a strong position for continued future advances.

Hahn shows that for languages where acceptance depends on a single input symbol, a transformer's classification decisions get closer and closer to random guessing (that is, a cross-entropy of 1) as input strings get longer and longer. We examine this limitation using two languages: PARITY, the language of bit strings with an odd number of 1s, and FIRST, the language of bit strings starting with a 1. We demonstrate three ways of overcoming the limitation implied by Hahn's lemma. First, we settle an open question by constructing a transformer that recognizes PARITY with perfect accuracy, and similarly for FIRST. Second, we use layer normalization to bring the cross-entropy of both models arbitrarily close to zero. Third, when transformers need to focus on a single position, as for FIRST, we find that they can fail to generalize to longer strings; we offer a simple remedy to this problem that also improves length generalization in machine translation.",november,True,23.9661089331454,-13.792468651301485

Qs__2rPyrl,Dynamic Entity Memory Network for Dialogue Relational Triplet Extraction,"Relational triplet extraction (RTE) is a crucial task in information extraction and has aroused extensive attention. Although advanced studies on RTE have achieved great progress, they are still insufficient for supporting practical applications, such as dialogue system and information retrieval. In this paper, we focus on relational triplet extraction in dialogue scenarios and introduce a new task named dialogue relational triplet extraction (DRTE). Instead of being treated as static texts like sentences or documents, dialogues should be regarded as dynamic ones generated with the progress of conversations. Thus, it imposes three important challenges, including extracting triplets in real-time with incomplete dialogue context, discovering cross-utterance relational triplets, and perceiving the transition of dialogue topics. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Entity Memory Network (DEMN). Specifically, the key of our approach is an attentional context encoder and an entity memory network. The attentional context encoder learns dialogue semantics utterance by utterance and dynamically captures salient contexts for each utterance. The entity memory network is devised to store the entities extracted from previous utterances and for cross-utterance triplets extraction. Meanwhile, it also tracks topic transitions in real-time and forgets the semantics of trivial entities. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we manually build three datasets based on KdConv benchmark.

WSv53LzVXuH,Searching for fingerspelled content in American Sign Language,"Natural language processing for sign language video---including tasks like recognition, translation, and search---is crucial for making artificial intelligence technologies accessible to deaf individuals, and is gaining research interest in recent years.  In this paper, we address the problem of searching for fingerspelled keywords or key phrases in raw sign language videos.  This is an important task since significant content in sign language is often conveyed via fingerspelling, and to our knowledge the task has not been studied before.  We propose an end-to-end model for this task, FSS-Net, that jointly detects fingerspelling and matches it to a text sequence. Our experiments, done on a large public dataset of ASL fingerspelling in the wild, show the importance of fingerspelling detection as a component of a search and retrieval model.

However, manual creation of such descriptions across many languages is a fraught process, as creating language descriptions which describe the language in ""its own terms"" without bias or error requires both a deep understanding of the language at hand and linguistics as a whole. We propose an automatic framework AutoLEX that aims to ease linguists' discovery and extraction of concise descriptions of linguistic phenomena.  Specifically, we apply this framework to extract descriptions for three linguistic phenomena: morphological agreement, case marking, and word order, across several languages. We evaluate the extracted descriptions with the help of language experts and propose a method for automated evaluation when human evaluation is infeasible.",november,True,4.171024952808902,-9.07050257409911

Preprocessing, which determines the representation of text features, is one of the key steps of text classification architecture.

However, the complexity of multi-hop QA hinders the effectiveness of the generative QA approach. In this work, we propose a simple generative approach (PathFid) that extends the task beyond just answer generation by explicitly modeling the reasoning process to resolve the answer for multi-hop questions. By linearizing the hierarchical reasoning path of supporting passages, their key sentences, and finally the factoid answer, we cast the problem as a single sequence prediction task. To facilitate complex reasoning with multiple clues, we further extend the unified flat representation of multiple input documents by encoding cross-passage interactions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFid leads to strong performance gains on two multi-hop QA datasets: HotpotQA and IIRC. Besides the performance gains, PathFid is more interpretable, which in turn yields answers that are more faithfully grounded to the supporting passages and facts compared to the baseline Fid model.",november,True,4.054736118008056,16.3710004705522

As pointed out by Williamson et al. (2010), such models implicitly assume that the probability of a topic to be active and its proportion within each document are positively correlated. This correlation can be strongly detrimental in the case of documents created over time, simply because recent documents are likely better described by new and hence rare topics.  In this work we leverage recent advances in neural variational inference and present an alternative neural approach to the Focused Topic Model and its dynamic extensions. Indeed, we develop a neural model for topic evolution which exploits a compound Bernoulli structure in order to track the appearances of topics, thereby decoupling their activities from their proportions.

We study this question by conducting extensive empirical analysis that shed light on important features of successful instructional prompts.

Some examples include decomposing a complex task instruction into multiple simpler tasks or itemizing instructions into sequential steps. Our experiments compare the zero-shot and few-shot performance of LMs prompted with reframed instructions on 12 NLP tasks across 6 categories. Compared with original instructions, our reframed instructions lead to  significant improvements across LMs with different sizes, underscoring the cross-model generality of these guidelines. For example, the same reframed prompts boost few-shot performance of GPT3-series and GPT2-series by 12.5% and 6.7% respectively averaged over all tasks. Furthermore,  reframed instructions reduce the number of examples required to prompt LMs in the few-shot setting.

uMF63VjD7FF,Neighbour Contrastive Learning with Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks on Short Text Classification,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted extensive research interests in text classification tasks, due to their superiority in representation learning. However, most existing studies adopt the same semi-supervised learning setting as the vanilla Graph Convolution Network (GCN), which require a large amount of labelled data during training and thus are less robust when dealing with large-scale graph data with few labels. Additionally, graph structure information is normally captured by direct information aggregation via network schema and missing adjacency knowledge may hinder the performance. Addressing those problems, this paper proposes a novel method to learn graph structure, by using simple neighbour contrastive learning for an existing self-supervised heterogeneous graph neural network model (NC-HGAT). It considers the graph structure information from heterogeneous graphs with a multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and delivers consistent results, despite the corrupted neighbouring connections. Extensive experiments have been implemented on four benchmark short-text datasets, and demonstrate that our proposed model NC-HGAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three datasets and achieves a competitive result on the remaining dataset.",november,True,-1.4817737875380892,3.2856732297857376

Correspondingly, the N-way K-shot NER task is proposed to recognize entities in the given N categories with only K labeled samples for each category. Existing methods treat this task as a sequence labeling problem, while this paper regards it as an entity span classification problem and designs a Biaffine Span Representation (BSR) method to learn contextual span dependency representation to fit into the classification algorithm. The BSR applies a biaffine pooling module to establish the dependencies of each word on the whole sentence and to reduce the dimension of word features, thus, the span representation could gain contextual dependency information to help improve recognition accuracies. Experimental study on four standard NER datasets shows that our proposed BSR method outperforms pre-trained language models and existing N-way K-shot NER algorithms in two types of adaptations (i.e., Intra-Domain Cross-Type Adaptation and Cross-Domain Cross-Type Adaptation).

FzJk5alRVP,Do Current Natural Language Inference Models Truly Understand Sentences? Insights from Simple Sentences,"Natural language inference (NLI) is a task to infer the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis (e.g. entailment, neutral, or contradiction), and transformer-based models perform well on current NLI datasets such as MNLI and SNLI. Nevertheless, given the complexity of the task, especially the complexity of the sentences used for model evaluations, it remains controversial whether these models can truly infer the meaning of sentences or they simply guess the answer via non-humanlike heuristics. Here, we reduce the complexity of the task using two approaches. The first approach simplifies the relationship between the premise and hypothesis by making them unrelated. A test set, referred to as Random Pair, is constructed by randomly pairing premises and hypotheses in MNLI/SNLI. Models fine-tuned on MNLI/SNLI identify a large proportion (up to 77.6%) of these unrelated statements as being contradictory. Models fine-tuned on SICK, a dataset that included unrelated premise-hypothesis pairs, perform well on Random Pair. The second approach simplifies the task by constraining the premises/hypotheses to be syntactically/semantically simple sentences. A new test set, referred to as Simple Pair, is constructed using simple sentences, such as short SVO sentences, and basic conjunction sentences. We find that models fine-tuned on MNLI/SNLI generally fail to understand these simple sentences, but their performance can be boosted by re-fine-tuning the models using only a few hundreds of samples from SICK. All models tested here, however, fail to understand the fundamental compositional binding relation between a subject and a predicate (up to ~100% error rate) for basic conjunction sentences. Taken together, the results show that models achieving high accuracy on mainstream datasets can still lack basic sentence comprehension capacity, and datasets discouraging non-humanlike heuristics are required to build more robust NLI models.",november,True,-2.8705620506132123,-7.99522820769983

Few previous studies have investigated the mention integration, which may be problematic because coreferential mentions do not equally contribute to a specific relation.

In this paper, we propose two novel techniques, Context Guided Mention Integration and Inter-pair Reasoning (CGM2IR), to improve the DRE. Instead of simply applying average pooling, the contexts are utilized to guide the integration of coreferential mentions in a weighted sum manner. Additionally, inter-pair reasoning executes an iterative algorithm on the entity pair graph, so as to model the interdependency of relations.

Specifically, MoEfication consists of two phases: (1) splitting the parameters of feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) into multiple parts as experts, and (2) building expert routers to decide which experts will be used for each input. Experimental results show that MoEfication can save $80\%$ computation cost of FFNs while maintaining over $95\%$ original performance for different models, including models with different sizes (up to 3 billion parameters) and distilled models, on various downstream tasks. Moreover, we find that the MoEfied model achieves better performance than the MoE model pre-trained from scratch with the same model size. We will release all the code and models of this paper.

u-g1ga9F6e-,SUPERB-SG: Enhanced Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark for Semantic and Generative Capabilities,"Transfer learning has proven to be crucial in advancing the state of speech and natural language processing research in recent years. In speech, a model pre-trained by self-supervised learning transfers remarkably well on multiple tasks. However, the lack of a consistent evaluation methodology is limiting towards a holistic understanding of the efficacy of such models. SUPERB was a step towards introducing a common benchmark to evaluate pre-trained models across various speech tasks. In this paper, we introduce SUPERB-SG, a new benchmark focusing on evaluating the semantic and generative capabilities of pre-trained models by increasing task diversity and difficulty over SUPERB. We use a lightweight methodology to test the robustness of representations learned by pre-trained models under shifts in data domain and quality across different types of tasks. It entails freezing pre-trained model parameters, only using simple task-specific trainable heads. The goal is to be inclusive of all researchers, and encourage efficient use of computational resources. We also show that the task diversity of SUPERB-SG coupled with limited task supervision is an effective recipe for evaluating the generalizability of model representation.",november,True,10.401597596264844,-18.559234371487264

avbPntXOwCW,Building Chinese Biomedical Language Models via Multi-Level Text Discrimination,"Pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and GPT, have revolutionized the field of NLP, not only in the general domain but also in the biomedical domain. Most prior efforts in building biomedical PLMs have resorted simply to domain adaptation and focused mainly on English. In this work we introduce eHealth, a Chinese biomedical PLM built from scratch with a new pre-training framework. This new framework pre-trains eHealth as a discriminator through both token- and sequence-level discrimination. The former is to detect input tokens corrupted by a generator and recover their original identities from plausible candidates, while the latter is to further distinguish corruptions of a same original sequence from those of others. As such, eHealth can learn language semantics at both token and sequence levels. Extensive experiments on 11 Chinese biomedical language understanding tasks of various forms verify the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. We release the pre-trained model to the public,\footnote{\url{Anonymous URL}} and will also release the code later.",november,True,-8.80892859156213,-22.162919194369927
moQDm_ezXNA,Active Relation Discovery: Towards General and Label-aware OpenRE,"Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) aims to discover and label novel relations from open domains. Previous methods mainly suffer from two problems: (1) Insufficient capacity to discriminate between known and novel relations. When extending conventional test settings to a more general setting where test data might also come from seen classes, existing OpenRE approaches have a significant performance decline. (2) Secondary labeling must be performed before practical application. Existing methods cannot label human-readable and meaningful types for novel relations, which is urgently required by the downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose the Active Relation Discovery (ARD) framework, which utilizes relational outlier detection for discriminating known and novel relations and involves active learning for labeling novel relations. Extensive experiments\footnote{The source code will be available for reproducibility.} on three real-world datasets show that ARD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both conventional and our proposed general OpenRE settings.

A Pilot Study of Dataset Evaluation for Text Classification,"In this paper, we ask the research question if all the datasets in the benchmark are necessary. We approach this by first characterizing the distinguishability of datasets when comparing different systems. Experiments on 9 datasets and 36 systems show that several existing benchmark datasets contribute little to discriminating top-scoring systems, while those less used datasets exhibit impressive discriminative power. We further, taking the text classification task as a case study, investigate the possibility of predicting dataset discrimination based on its properties (e.g., average sentence length). Our preliminary experiments promisingly show that given a sufficient number of training experimental records, a meaningful predictor can be learned to estimate dataset discrimination over unseen datasets.

rn8YIulHv03,Program Transfer for Answering Complex Questions over Knowledge Bases,"Program induction for answering complex questions over knowledge bases (KBs) aims to decompose a question into a multi-step program, whose execution against the KB produces the final answer.  Learning to induce programs relies on a large number of parallel question-program pairs for the given KB. However, for most KBs, the gold program annotations are usually lacking, making learning difficult. In this paper, we propose the approach of program transfer, which aims to leverage the valuable program annotations on the rich-resourced KBs as external supervision signals to aid program induction for the low-resourced KBs  that lack program annotations. For program transfer, we design a novel two-stage parsing framework with an efficient ontology-guided pruning strategy.  First, a sketch parser translates the question into a high-level program sketch, which is the composition of functions. Second, given the question and sketch, an argument parser searches the detailed arguments from the KB for functions. During the searching, we incorporate the KB ontology to prune the search space. The experiments on ComplexWebQuestions and WebQuestionSP show that our method outperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of program transfer and our framework.

Although being of great academic and practical interest, this problem is still shadowed by the lack of a well-posed theoretical framework; existing work usually relies on various notions of correlation and is susceptible to confounding co-occurrences. This paper articulates the central question of CCR and develops a novel framework, ROCK, to Reason O(A)bout Commonsense K(C)ausality based on classical causal inference principles.

However, most state-of-the-art pretrained language models (LM) are unable to efficiently process long text for many summarization tasks. In this paper, we propose Summ$^N$, a simple, flexible, and effective multi-stage framework for input texts that are longer than the maximum context length of typical pretrained LMs. Summ$^N$ first splits the data samples and generates a coarse summary in multiple stages and then produces the final fine-grained summary based on it. Our framework can process input text of arbitrary length by adjusting the number of stages while keeping the LM input size fixed. Moreover, it can deal with both single-source documents and dialogues, and it can be used on top of different backbone abstractive summarization models. To the best of our knowledge, Summ$^N$ is the first multi-stage split-then-summarize framework for long input summarization. Our experiments demonstrate that Summ$^N$ outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by improving ROUGE scores on three long meeting summarization datasets AMI, ICSI, and QMSum, two long TV series datasets from SummScreen, and a long document summarization dataset GovReport.

TqUzRS4WNQK,ED2LM: Encoder-Decoder to Language Model for Faster Document Re-ranking Inference,"State-of-the-art neural models typically encode document-query pairs using cross-attention for re-ranking. To this end, models generally utilize an encoder-only (like BERT) paradigm or an encoder-decoder (like T5) approach. These paradigms, however, are not without flaws, i.e., running the model on all query-document pairs at inference-time incurs a significant computational cost. This paper proposes a new training and inference paradigm for re-ranking. We propose to finetune a pretrained encoder-decoder model using in the form of document to query generation. Subsequently, we show that this encoder-decoder architecture can be decomposed into a decoder-only language model during inference. This results in significant inference time speedups since the decoder-only architecture only needs to learn to interpret static encoder embeddings during inference. Our experiments show that this new paradigm achieves results that are comparable to the more expensive cross-attention ranking approaches while being up to 6.8X faster.

To address this problem, we leverage Flooding method which primarily aims at better generalization and we find promising in defending adversarial attacks. We further propose an effective criterion to bring hyper-parameter-dependent flooding into effect with a narrowed-down search space by measuring how the gradient steps taken within one epoch affect the loss of each batch. Our approach requires zero adversarial sample for training, and its time consumption is equivalent to fine-tuning, which can be 2-15 times faster than standard adversarial training. We experimentally show that our method improves Bert's resistance to textual adversarial attacks by a large margin, and achieves state-of-the-art robust accuracy on various text classification and GLUE tasks.",november,True,-21.006269552982438,-20.326816446835338

In this work, we study the challenge of imposing roles on open-domain dialogue systems, with the goal of making the systems maintain consistent roles while conversing naturally with humans. To accomplish this, the system must satisfy a role specification that includes certain conditions on the stated features as well as a system policy on whether or not certain types of utterances are allowed. For this, We propose an efficient data collection framework leveraging in-context few-shot learning of large-scale language models for building role-satisfying dialogue dataset from scratch.

Transformer NMT models are typically strengthened by deeper encoder layers, but deepening their decoder layers usually results in failure. In this paper, we first identify the cause of the failure of the deep decoder in the Transformer model. Inspired by this discovery, we then propose approaches to improving it, with respect to model structure and model training, to make the deep decoder practical in NMT. Specifically, with respect to model structure, we propose a cross-attention drop mechanism to allow the decoder layers to perform their own different roles, to reduce the difficulty of deep-decoder learning. For model training, we propose a collapse reducing training approach to improve the stability and effectiveness of deep-decoder training. We experimentally evaluated our proposed Transformer NMT model structure modification and novel training methods on several popular machine translation benchmarks. The results showed that deepening the NMT model by increasing the number of decoder layers successfully prevented the deepened decoder from degrading to an unconditional language model. In contrast to prior work on deepening an NMT model on the encoder, our method can deepen the model on both the encoder and decoder at the same time, resulting in a deeper model and improved performance.",november,True,25.11064464916141,-29.007497451372505

kCbUq8tjwNc,Crossword: Estimating Unknown Embeddings using Cross Attention and Alignment Strategies,"Word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe have been shown to learn strong representations of words.  However, these methods only learn representations for words in the training corpus.  This is problematic, as models using these representations need ways to handle unknown and new words, known as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.  As a result, there have been multiple attempts to learn OOV word representations in a similar fashion to how humans learn new words, using surrounding words (``context clues"") and word roots/subwords.  However, most current approaches suffer from two problems.  First, these models calculate context clue estimates and subword estimates separately and then combine them shallowly for a final estimate, therefore ignoring potentially important information each type can learn from the other.  Secondly, although subword embeddings are trained to estimate word vectors, we find these embeddings don't occupy the same space as word embeddings.  Current models do not take this into account, and do not align the spaces before combining them.  In response to this, we propose Crossword, a transformer based OOV estimation model that combines context and subwords at the attention level, allowing each type to influence the other for a stronger final estimate.

However, we observe that the original approach to calculating distinct scores has evident biases that tend to add higher penalties to longer sequences. In this paper, we refine the calculation of distinct scores by re-scaling the number of distinct tokens based on its expectation. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence to show that our method effectively removes the biases exhibited in the original distinct score.

Besides the difficulty of image generation, the generator also need to conform to the narrative of a multi-sentence story input.  While prior arts in this domain has focused on improving semantic relevance between generated images and input text, controlling the generated images to be temporally consistent still remains as a challenge. To generate a semantically coherent image sequence, we propose an explicit memory controller which can augment the temporal coherence of images in the multi-modal autoregressive transformer, and call Story visualization by MultimodAl Recurrent Transformers or SMART for short.

For the propose, we devise an efficient causal rule discovery algorithm called CaRules that distills the causal rules between two knowledge graph schemata abstracted from instances from massive knowledge graphs.

However, little is understood about this fine-tuning process, including what knowledge is retained from pre-training models or how content selection and generation strategies are learnt across iterations. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics for generation models, focusing on news summarization. Across different datasets (CNN/DM, XSum, MediaSum) and model behaviors (content selection, abstractiveness, hallucination), we study what the model learns at different stages of its fine-tuning process. We find that properties such as copy behavior and content selection are learnt earlier in the training process and these observations are robust across domains. On the other hand, factual errors, such as hallucination of unsupported facts, are learnt in the later stages, and this behavior is more varied across domains. Based on these observations, we demonstrate two techniques for modifying training: first, disregarding high-loss tokens that are challenging to learn and second, disregarding low-loss tokens that are learnt very quickly. We show that these simple modifications can help achieve different goals, such as improving factuality or improving abstractiveness. ",november,True,5.711306635275831,-17.634459802795387

A typical approach is to leverage unsupervised and semi-supervised learning to train a neural encoder to produce representations of utterances that are adequate for clustering then perform clustering on the representations to detect unseen clusters of intents. Recently, instance-level contrastive learning has been proposed to improve representation quality for better clustering. However, the proposed method suffers from semantic distortion in text augmentation and even from representation inadequacy due to limitations of using representations of pre-trained language models, typically BERT. Neural encoders can be powerful representation learners, but the initial parameters of pre-trained language models do not reliably produce representations that are suitable for capturing semantic distances.

Existing approaches to commonsense inference utilize commonsense transformers, which are large-scale language models that learn commonsense knowledge graphs.

In this paper, we focus on addressing missing relations in commonsense knowledge graphs, and propose a novel contrastive learning framework called SOLAR. Our framework contrasts sets of semantically similar and dissimilar events, learning richer inferential knowledge compared to existing approaches. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of SOLAR in commonsense inference of diverse commonsense knowledge graphs.

However, state-of-the-art entity retrievers struggle to retrieve rare entities in queries.  There are two key challenges: (1) most retrievers are trained on unstructured text about entities and ignore structured data about entities that can be challenging to learn from text, such as entity types, and (2) methods that leverage structured types are not designed for end-to-end retrieval, which is necessary for open-domain tasks.  In this work, we introduce a method, TABi, to jointly train bi-encoders on unstructured text and structured types for end-to-end retrieval. TABi uses a type-enforced contrastive loss to encode type information in the embedding space and trains over datasets from multiple open-domain tasks to learn to retrieve entities. We demonstrate that this simple method can improve retrieval of rare entities on the AmbER sets, while maintaining strong overall performance on retrieval for open-domain tasks when compared to state-of-the-art retrievers.

In this paper, we find that the contextualized representations of the same word in different contexts have a greater cosine similarity than those of two different words, but this self-similarity is still relatively low between the same words. This suggests that output of machine translation models produce more context-specific representations. In this work, we present a contrastive framework for machine translation, that adopts contrastive learning to train  model in a supervised way.

Although some bilinear methods succeed in modeling these patterns, they neglect to handle 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relations (or complex relations) concurrently, which hurts their expressiveness. To this end, we integrate scaling, the combination of translation and rotation that can solve complex relations and patterns, respectively, where scaling is a simplification of projection. Therefore, we propose a corresponding bilinear model Scaling Translation and Rotation (STaR) consisting of the above two parts. Besides, since translation can not be incorporated into the bilinear model directly, we introduce translation matrix as the equivalent. Theoretical analysis proves that STaR is capable of modeling all patterns and handling complex relations simultaneously, and experiments demonstrate its effectiveness on commonly used benchmarks for link prediction.

Our goal is to allow users to correct such errors directly through interaction -- without retraining. Our approach is to pair GPT-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model misunderstood the user's intent and was provided with feedback, clarifying the instruction. Given a new query, our memory-enhanced GPT-3 uses feedback from similar, prior queries to enrich the prompt. Through simple proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate how a user can interactively teach a deployed GPT-3, doubling its accuracy on basic lexical tasks (e.g., generate a synonym) where users query in different, novel (often misunderstood) ways.

To improve the ability of fast cross-domain adaptation, we propose Prompt-based Environmental Self-exploration (ProbES), which can self-explore the environments by sampling trajectories and automatically generates structured instructions via a large-scale cross-modal pretrained model (CLIP). Our method fully utilizes the knowledge learned from CLIP to build an in-domain dataset by self-exploration without human labeling. Unlike the conventional approach of fine-tuning, we introduce prompt tuning to achieve fast adaptation for language embeddings, which substantially improves the learning efficiency by leveraging prior knowledge.

7A4Fel5OBYQ,Metadata Shaping: Natural Language Annotations for the Long Tail,"Language models (LMs) struggle to capture knowledge about rare entities. To better capture entity knowledge, a common procedure in prior work is to start with a base LM such as BERT and to modify the LM architecture or objective function to produce a knowledge-aware LM. Proposed knowledge-aware LMs perform well compared to base LMs on entity-rich tasks; however deploying, understanding, and maintaining many different specialized architectures is challenging, and they also often introduce additional computational costs. Thus we ask to what extent we can match the quality of these architectures using a base LM and only changing the data. We propose metadata shaping, a method which inserts readily available entity metadata, such as descriptions and categorical tags, into examples at train and inference time based on mutual information. Intuitively, if metadata corresponding to popular entities overlap with metadata for rare entities, the LM may be able to better reason about the rare entities using patterns learned from similar popular entities. On standard entity-rich tasks (TACRED, FewRel, OpenEntity), metadata shaping exceeds the BERT-baseline by an average of 4.3 F1 points and achieves state-of-the-art results. We further show the gains are on average 4.4x larger for the slice of examples containing tail vs. popular entities.",november,True,-1.1960392618015179,-18.32610730251535

IFISLX7krsj,Feature-rich Open-vocabulary Interpretable Neural Representations for All of the World’s 7000 Languages,"Modern NLP research is firmly predicated on two assumptions: that very large corpora are available, and that the word, rather than the morpheme, is the primary meaning-bearing unit of language. For the vast majority of the world's languages, these assumptions fail to hold, and as a result existing state-of-the-art neural representations such as BERT fail to meet the needs of thousands of languages. In this paper, we present a novel general-purpose neural representation using Tensor Product Representations that is designed from the beginning to be both linguistically interpretable and fully capable of handling the broad variety found in the world's diverse set of 7000 languages, regardless of corpus size or morphological characteristics.  We demonstrate the applicability of our representation through examples drawn from a typologically diverse set of languages whose morphology includes prefixes, suffixes, infixes, circumfixes, templatic morphemes, derivational morphemes, inflectional morphemes, and reduplication.",november,True,-3.5622842950992766,-5.2691648566987075

However, for the continual increase of online chit-chat scenarios, directly fine-tuning these models for each of the new tasks not only explodes the capacity of the dialogue system on the embedded devices but also causes knowledge forgetting on pre-trained models and knowledge interference between diverse dialogue tasks.  In this work, we propose a hierarchical inductive transfer framework to learn and deploy the dialogue skills continually and efficiently.  First, we introduce the adapter module into pre-trained models for learning new dialogue tasks. As the only trainable module, it is beneficial for the dialogue system on the embedded devices to acquire new dialogue skills with negligible additional parameters.  Then, for alleviating knowledge interference between tasks yet benefiting the regularization between them, we further design hierarchical inductive transfer that enables new tasks to use general knowledge in the base adapter without being misled by diverse knowledge in task-specific adapters.

Recently, an interesting approach, namely negative training, has been proposed to alleviate this problem by reminding the model not to generate high-frequency responses during training. However, its performance is hindered by two issues, ignoring low-frequency but generic responses and bringing low-frequency but meaningless responses. In this paper, we propose a novel negative training paradigm, called negative distillation, to keep the model away from the undesirable generic responses while avoiding the above problems.  First, we introduce a negative teacher model that can produce query-wise generic responses, and then the student model is required to maximize the distance with multi-level negative knowledge.

It has been estimated that developers spend almost 20\% of their time in fixed problems with their code. Therefore tools which can automatically repair code can help accelerate the DevOps cycles. In this work we build upon recent success of deploying neuro-symbolic approaches for automatic code repair. In our approach, we use a dataset of python code, viz, CodeNet, which represents data distribution for human generated code. We train two neural modules a breaker and a fixer, which are trained iteratively, along with a symbolic module Pylint. The breaker learns to introduce errors in the code, the symbolic module acts as a Critic and is able to fragment the error by identifying the line, as well provide the error type with a specific exception message. The Fixer utilizes the exception message to repair the erroneous line in the code. We are able to cover 32 different syntax errors, and iterative training based on back translation actually helps improve the performance of the Fixer.

To address these problems, we introduce a new task BBAI: Black-Box Agent Integration, focusing on combining the capabilities of multiple black-box CAs at scale.

We also address the well-established problem of compounding errors by mixing the latent codes of past predictions and past targets in one of two ways: (1) according to a predefined sampling schedule or (2) a differentiable sampling procedure that replaces the argmax operation. Low dimensional codes show similar performance to models that use the full softmax and outperform alternative approximate methods for language modeling and text generation, while generation further benefits from our mixture sampling.

In this paper, we show that general abusive language classifiers tend to be fairly reliable in detecting out-of-domain explicitly abusive utterances but fail to detect new types of more subtle, implicit abuse. Next, we propose an interpretability technique, based on the Testing Concept Activation Vector (TCAV) method from computer vision, to quantify the sensitivity of a trained model to the human-defined concepts of explicit and implicit abusive language, and use that to explain the generalizability of the model on new data, in this case, COVID-related anti-Asian hate speech.

However, the large model size makes difficult to apply the model to a task requiring domain knowledge not included in the training corpus, due to the fact that knowledge stored in model parameters is not controllable during generation and model parameter updates are costly. To tackle the problem, we suggest separating the language model and knowledge, and divide the end-to-end language model into three parts: 1) encoding knowledge, 2) processing the encoded knowledge, and 3) restoring the processed knowledge embedding to natural language. In this paper, we propose a model for learning restorable embeddings as a first step toward the study to separate the language model and knowledge. The experimental results shows that the proposed model can restore most knowledge in 1-2 sentences by encoding knowledge in sentence-level embeddings and then restoring the embeddings back to the original sentence.

In this paper, we propose an evaluation paradigm that assesses NLP technologies across all three dimensions, hence quantifying the diversity of users they can serve. While inclusion and accessibility have received attention in recent literature, equity is currently unexplored. We propose to address this gap using the Gini coefficient, a well-established metric used for estimating societal wealth inequality. Using our paradigm, we highlight the distressed state of diversity of current technologies for Indian (IN) languages.

To improve upon these metrics, we demonstrate the importance of region-specific choices in model building and dataset creation and also propose a novel approach to optimal resource allocation during fine-tuning.

vuAX_4bv8A,CausalR: Causal Reasoning over Natural Language Rulebases,"Transformers have been shown to perform deductive reasoning on a logical rulebase containing rules and statements written in natural language. Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model’s logical reasoning process. But these models behave as a black-box unit that emulates the reasoning process without any causal constraints in the reasoning steps, thus questioning the faithfulness. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task as a causal process by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our causal reasoning framework, we propose CausalR, where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that CausalR is robust to novel language perturbations, and performs on par with previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Furthermore, the errors made by CausalR are more interpretable due to our multi-modular approach compared to black-box generative models.",november,True,-2.48051898585089,-1.5660095420476339

Thus, the framework is able to both create and leverage auxiliary supervision by itself.

H_LmmxjQrqw,Distill and Calibrate: Denoising Inconsistent Labeling Instances for Chinese Named Entity Recognition,"Data-driving supervised models for named entity recognition (NER) have made significant improvements on standard benchmarks. However, such models often have severe performance degradation on large-scale noisy data. Thus, a practical and challenging question arises: Can we leverage only a small amount of relatively clean data to guide the NER model learning from large-scale noisy data? To answer this question, we focus on the inconsistent labeling instances problem. We observe that inconsistent labeling instances can be classified into five types of noise, each of which will largely hinder the model performance in our experiments. Based on the above observation, we propose a simple yet effective denoising framework named Distillation and Calibration for Chinese NER (DCNER). DCNER consists: (1) a Dual-stream Label Distillation mechanism for distilling five types of inconsistent labeling instances from the noisy data; and (2) a Consistency-aware Label Calibration network for calibrating inconsistent labeling instances based on relatively clean data.  Additionally, we propose the first benchmark towards validating the ability of Chinese NER to resist inconsistent labeling instances. Finally, detailed experiments show that our method consistently and significantly outperforms previous methods on the proposed benchmark.",november,True,-29.639976705623294,-7.509926565136045

Ougcw7mdk8u,How Well Do Multi-hop Reading Comprehension Models Understand Date Information?,"Many previous works demonstrated that existing multi-hop reading comprehension datasets (e.g., HotpotQA) contain reasoning shortcuts, where the questions can be answered without performing multi-hop reasoning. Recently, several multi-hop datasets have been proposed to solve the reasoning shortcut problem or evaluate the internal reasoning process. However, the design of the reasoning chain for comparison questions in R4C and 2WikiMultiHopQA does not fully explain the answer; meanwhile, MuSiQue only focuses on bridge questions. Therefore, it is unclear about the ability of a model to perform step-by-step reasoning when finding an answer for a comparison question that requires comparison and numerical reasoning skills. To evaluate the model completely in a hierarchical manner, we first propose a dataset, HieraDate, created by reusing and enhancing two previous multi-hop datasets, HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA. Our dataset focuses on comparison questions on date information that require multi-hop reasoning for solving. We then evaluate the ability of existing models to understand date at three levels: extraction, reasoning, and robustness. Our experimental results reveal that the multi-hop models fail at the reasoning level. Comparison reasoning and numerical reasoning (e.g., subtraction) are key challenges that need to be addressed in future works.",november,True,-2.4374421238918726,12.05583421411611

6DOaEO5KV0,ICLEA: Interactive Contrastive Learning for Self-supervised Entity Alignment,"Self-supervised entity alignment (EA) aims to link equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs) without seed alignments. The current SOTA self-supervised EA method draws inspiration from contrastive learning, originally designed in computer vision based on instance discrimination and contrastive loss, and suffers from two shortcomings. Firstly, it puts unidirectional emphasis on pushing sampled negative entities far away rather than pulling positively aligned pairs close, as is done in the well-established supervised EA. Secondly, KGs contain rich side information (e.g., entity description), and how to effectively leverage those information has not been adequately investigated in self-supervised EA. In this paper, we propose an interactive contrastive learning model for self-supervised EA. The model encodes not only structures and semantics of entities (including entity name, entity description, and entity neighborhood), but also conducts cross-KG contrastive learning by building pseudo-aligned entity pairs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous best self-supervised results by a large margin (over 9% average improvement) and performs on par with previous SOTA supervised counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the interactive contrastive learning for self-supervised EA.",november,True,-34.03623284155303,-0.9565495316853535

However, these methods are limited in that they can only be applied to modules implemented using trainable neural-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a method for optimizing a pipeline system composed of modules implemented with arbitrary methods for dialogue performance. In our method, neural-based components called post-processing networks (PPNs) are installed inside the system to post-process the output of each module. All PPNs are updated to improve the overall dialogue performance of the system by using reinforcement learning, not necessitating each module to be updated. Through dialogue simulation experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, we show that PPNs can improve the dialogue performance of pipeline systems consisting of various modules.",november,True,40.65129325022999,7.066693681512267

Models often combine pre-trained text encoders with a graph encoder to use this information to increase accuracy. However, the way that these two types of model interact is not clear. Here we show that, when provided with graph information for a random question, two recent models exhibit no significant change in performance. These models cannot therefore be used to obtain graph-structured explanations, or to compare the relevance of a particular knowledge graph to a dataset. We perform two model ablations and show that the resulting model is more responsive to variation in graph input, and so can be used for gathering explanations and measuring KG-dataset fit.

0bntqrz16gU,Can Language Models Be Specific? How?,"A good speaker needs not only to be correct but also to be specific, and so are language models. In this paper, we propose to measure how specific the language of pre-trained language models (PLMs) is. To achieve this, we introduce a novel approach to build a benchmark for specificity testing by forming masked token prediction tasks with prompts. For instance, given ``J. K. Rowling was born in [MASK].'', we want to test whether a more specific answer will be better filled in by PLMs, e.g., Yate instead of England. From our evaluations, we show that existing PLMs have only a slight preference for more specific answers, indicating that PLMs are weak in specificity. We identify underlying factors affecting the specificity and design two prompt-based methods to improve the specificity. Results show that the specificity of the models can be improved by the proposed methods without additional training. We believe this work can provide a new insight for language modeling and encourage the research community to further explore this important but understudied problem.",november,True,-4.456041981818561,-21.12359904073329

Qgc_nVbdnFr,Schema-Free Dependency Parsing via Sequence Generation,"Dependency parsing aims to extract syntactic dependency structure or semantic dependency structure for sentences. Existing methods suffer the drawbacks of lacking universality or highly relying on the auxiliary decoder. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose to achieve universal and schema-free Dependency Parsing (DP) via Sequence Generation (SG) DPSG by utilizing only the pre-trained language model (PLM) without any auxiliary structures or parsing algorithms. We first explore different serialization designing strategies for converting parsing structures into sequences. Then we design dependency units and concatenate these units into the sequence for DPSG. Thanks to the high flexibility of the sequence generation, our DPSG can achieve both syntactic DP and semantic DP using a single model. By concatenating the prefix to indicate the specific schema with the sequence, our DPSG can even accomplish the multi-schemata parsing. The effectiveness of our DPSG is demonstrated by the experiments on widely used DP benchmarks, i.e., PTB, CODT, SDP15, and SemEval16. DPSG achieves comparable results with the first-tier methods on all the benchmarks and even the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in CODT and SemEval16. This paper demonstrates our DPSG has the potential to be a new parsing paradigm. We will release our codes upon acceptance.",november,True,-20.18707223625455,-7.9287539649368854

UI0P4BMeqqy,Effective Token Graph Modeling using a Novel Labeling Strategy for Structured Sentiment Analysis,"The state-of-the-art model for structured  sentiment analysis casts the task as a dependency parsing problem, which has some limitations: (1) The label proportions for span prediction and span relation prediction are imbalanced; (2) Two nodes in a dependency graph cannot have multiple arcs, which are necessary for this task; (3) The losses of predicting the imbalanced labels are directly applied in the prediction layer, which further exacerbate the imbalance problem. In this work, we propose nichetargeting solutions for this issues. First, we introduce a novel labeling strategy, which contains two sets of token pair labels, namely essential labels and whole labels. The essential label set consists of the minimum labels for this task, which are relatively balanced and applied in the prediction layer. The whole label set includes rich labels to help our model capture various token relations, which is imbalanced but merely applied in the hidden layer to softly influence our model. Moreover, we also propose an effective model to well collaborate with our labeling strategy, which is equipped with the graph attention network to iteratively refine token representations, and the adaptive multi-label classification to dynamically predict multiple relations between token pairs. We perform extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets in four languages. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous SOTA models by a large margin.

Qj5PZOZgPRS,Parameter-Efficient Abstractive Question Answering over Tables and over Text,"A long-term ambition of information seeking question answering (QA) systems is to reason over multi-modal contexts and generate natural answers to user queries. Today, memory intensive pre-trained language models are adapted to downstream tasks such as QA by fine-tuning the model on QA data in a specific modality like unstructured text or structured tables. To avoid training such memory-hungry models and utilizing a uniform architecture for each modality, parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques such as adapters add and train small task-specific bottle-neck layers between transformer layers. However, modality-specific adapter layers infused in a pre-trained transformer also require uniformity in the input sequence, which contradicts with existing work that trains structure-specific layers on multi-modal data. In this work, we study parameter-efficient abstractive QA in encoder-decoder models over structured tabular data and unstructured textual data using only 1.5% additional parameters for each modality. We retain table structure information by a hierarchy preserving transformation of complex hierarchical tables to 1-dimensional sequences, thus maintaining uniformity in the model input. We also ablate over adapter layers in both encoder and decoder modules and study the efficiency-performance trade-off and demonstrate that reducing additional trainable parameters down to 0.7%–1.0% leads to comparable results. Our models outperform current state-of-the-art models on tabular QA datasets such as Tablesum and FeTaQA and achieve comparable performance on a text QA dataset such as NarrativeQA using significantly less trainable parameters.",november,True,-0.09327900505050682,14.134431112867146

IbqvTfZZR7X,Extreme Multi-label Text Classification with Pseudo Label Descriptions,"Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is the task of tagging each document with the relevant labels in a large predefined label space, where the label frequency distribution is often highly skewed.  That is, a large portion of labels (namely the tail labels) have very few positive instances, posing a hard optimization problem for training the classification models.  The severe data sparse issue with tail labels is more announced in recent neural classifiers, where the embeddings of both the input documents and the output labels need to be jointly learned, and the success of such learning relies on the availability of sufficient training instances. This paper addresses this tough challenge in XMTC by proposing a novel approach that combines the strengths of both traditional bag-of-words (BoW) classifiers and recent neural embedding based classifiers.  Specifically, we use a trained BoW model to generate a pseudo description for each label, and apply a neural model to establish the mapping between input documents and target labels in the latent embedding spaces. Our experiments show significant improvements of the proposed approach over other strong baseline methods on benchmark datasets, especially on tail label prediction.

However, fine-tuning the entire model for every task of interest makes a copy of all the model parameters, rendering such scenarios highly impractical. Recently introduced Adapter methods propose a promising alternative, one where only a small number of additional parameters are introduced per task specifically for fine-tuning. However, Adapter often require large amounts of task-specific data for good performance and don't work well in data-scarce few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we take a meta-learning viewpoint for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in few-shot settings. We introduce Meta-Adapter, which are small blocks of meta-learned adapter layers inserted in a pre-trained model that re-purpose a frozen pre-trained model into a parameter-efficient few-shot learner. Meta-Adapter perform competitively with state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, that require full fine-tuning, while only fine-tuning 0.6\% of the parameters.

de9ufgUZFox,Graph-based Fine-grained Multimodal Attention Mechanism for Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is a popular research area in natural language processing. Mainstream multimodal learning models barely consider that the visual and acoustic behaviors often have a much higher temporal frequency than words. Therefore, these models lack the representation capability to accurately model multimodal interactions. In this paper, we propose an attachment called Graph-based Fine-grained Multimodal Attention Mechanism (GFMAM), which can utilize the multimodal information from different subspaces to achieve accurate multimodal interactions. Firstly, the attachment further splits the information of every modality into multiple subspaces. Then, the fine-grained multimodal information from different subspaces is converted into multimodal interaction graphs dominant by the language modality. The multimodal interaction graph can capture significant interactions among multiple modalities at the subspace level. Finally, the information of nonverbal modalities is additionally added to compensate for the loss of continuity caused by the splitting operation. Embedding GFMAM into BERT, we propose a new model called GFMAM-BERT that can directly accept nonverbal modalities in addition to language modality. We conducted experiments on both publicly available multimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experiment results demonstrate that GFMAM-BERT exceeds the state-of-the-art models.

We construct our simile property probing datasets from both general textual corpus and human-designed questions, which contain a total of 1,633 examples covering seven main categories. Our empirical study based on the constructed datasets shows that PLMs exhibit the ability to infer shared properties of similes, while they still underperform humans.

-3D06n-Fl0b,Is Cross-lingual Evaluation Only About Cross-lingual?,"Multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) have achieved great success on various cross-lingual tasks. However, we find that the higher performance on these tasks cannot be regarded as the better cross-lingual ability because models’ task-specific abilities can also influence the performance. In this work, we do a comprehensive study on two representative cross-lingual evaluation protocols: sentence retrieval and zero-shot transfer. We find that current cross-lingual evaluation results strongly depend on mPLMs' task-specific abilities so that the performance can be improved without any improvement in models' cross-lingual ability. To have more accurate comparisons of cross-lingual ability between mPLMs, we propose two new indexes based on the two evaluation protocols: calibrated sentence retrieval performance and transfer rate, and experimentally show that our proposed indexes effectively eliminate the effects of task-specific abilities on the cross-lingual evaluation.",november,True,10.045229263029345,-25.82550846694364

To address this issue, we introduce an evaluation framework that improves previous evaluation procedures in three key aspects, i.e., test performance, dev-test correlation, and stability. Under this new evaluation framework, we re-evaluate several state-of-the-art few-shot methods for NLU tasks. Our framework reveals new insights:  (1) both the absolute performance and relative gap of the methods were not accurately estimated in prior literature;  (2) no single method dominates most tasks with consistent performance;  (3) improvements of some methods diminish with a larger pretrained model; and (4) gains from different methods are often complementary and the best combined model performs close to a strong fully-supervised baseline.

In this paper, we propose Sparsefinder, a simple model trained to identify the sparsity pattern of entmax attention before computing it. We experiment with three variants of our method, based on distances, quantization, and clustering, on two tasks: machine translation (attention in the decoder) and masked language modeling (encoder-only).

The popularity of pretrained language models in natural language processing systems calls for a careful evaluation of such models in down-stream tasks, which have a higher potential for societal impact. The evaluation of such systems usually focuses on accuracy measures. Our findings in this paper call for attention to be paid to fairness measures as well. Through the analysis of more than a dozen pretrained language models of varying sizes on two toxic text classification tasks, we demonstrate that focusing on accuracy measures alone can lead to models with wide variation in fairness characteristics. Specifically, we observe that fairness can vary even more than accuracy with increasing training data size and different random initializations. At the same time, we find that little of the fairness variation is explained by model size, despite claims in the literature. To improve model fairness without retraining, we show that two post-processing methods developed for structured, tabular data can be successfully applied to a range of pretrained language models.",november,True,10.10886719663181,-14.248207606760822

However, topic classification of such posts is quite challenging because of (a) a large topic space (b) short text with weak topical cues, and (c) multiple topic associations per post. In contrast to most prior work which only focuses on post classification into a small number of topics ($10-20$), we consider the task of large-scale topic classification in the context of Twitter where the topic space is $10$ times larger with potentially multiple topic associations per Tweet. We address the challenges above and propose a novel neural model, CTM that (a) associates tweets from a large topic space of $300$ topics (b) takes a holistic approach to tweet content modeling -- leveraging multi-modal content, author context, and deeper semantic cues in the tweet.  We evaluate CTM quantitatively and show that our method offers an effective way to classify Tweets into topics at scale and is superior in performance to other approaches yielding a significant relative lift of $\mathbf{20}\%$.",november,True,13.440934180750116,20.908088437797893

y1DoH6Y75rK,Prix-LM: Pretraining for Multilingual Knowledge Base Construction,"Knowledge bases (KBs) contain plenty of structured world and commonsense knowledge. As such, they often complement distributional text-based information and facilitate various downstream tasks. Since their manual construction is resource- and time-intensive, recent efforts have tried leveraging large pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate additional monolingual knowledge facts for KBs. However, such methods have not been attempted for building and enriching multilingual KBs. Besides wider application, such multilingual KBs can provide richer combined knowledge than monolingual (e.g., English) KBs. Knowledge expressed in different languages may be complementary and unequally distributed: this implies that the knowledge available in high-resource languages can be transferred to low-resource ones. To achieve this, it is crucial to represent multilingual knowledge in a shared/unified space. To this end, we propose a unified representation model, Prix-LM, for multilingual KB construction and completion. We leverage two types of knowledge, monolingual triples and cross-lingual links, extracted from existing multilingual KBs, and tune a multilingual language encoder XLM-R via a causal language modeling objective. Prix-LM integrates useful multilingual and KB-based factual knowledge into a single model. Experiments on standard entity-related tasks, such as link prediction in multiple languages, cross-lingual entity linking and bilingual lexicon induction, demonstrate its effectiveness, with gains reported over strong task-specialised baselines.",november,True,-40.351866505247884,7.695972410946618

To address these challenges, we develop a Retrieve-Generate-Filter(RGF) technique to create counterfactual evaluation and training data with minimal human supervision. Using an open-domain QA framework and question generation model trained on original task data, we create counterfactuals that are fluent, semantically diverse, and automatically labeled.

MgEOyth-DZQ,Towards Robust Online Dialogue Response Generation,"Although pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models have achieved great success in dialogue response generation, chatbots still suffer from generating inconsistent responses in real-world practice, especially in multi-turn settings. We argue that this can be caused by a discrepancy between training and real-world testing. At training time, chatbots generate response with the golden context, while it has to generate based on the context consisting of both user utterances and the model predicted utterances during real-world testing. With the growth of the number of utterances, this discrepancy becomes more serious in the multi-turn settings. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical sampling-based method consisting of both utterance-level sampling and semi-utterance-level sampling, to alleviate the discrepancy, which implicitly increases the dialogue coherence. We further adopt reinforcement learning and re-ranking methods to explicitly optimize the dialogue coherence during training and inference, respectively. Empirical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed methods for improving the robustness of chatbots in real practice.",november,True,-17.5799724953298,9.470209512457489

Although glimpses of personality traits are observable in existing open domain conversation corpora, leveraging generic language modelling for response generation overlooks the interlocutor idiosyncrasies, resulting in non-customizable personality agnostic responses. With the motivation of enabling configurable response generators, in this paper we experiment with ways to ground neural response generators based on both (i) interlocutor Big-5 personality traits, and (ii) discourse intent as control codes, training an end-to-end dialogue agent that can not only leverage the control codes as policy for nuanced response generation, but also predict and decide the generation policy to be utilized by the generator. Since most of the existing large scale open domain chat corpora do not include Big-5 personality traits and discourse intent, we employ automatic annotation schemes to enrich the corpora with policy consisting of noisy estimates of these features as control codes, and leverage automatic evaluation metrics along with ablation studies, to assess the impact of using control codes for response generation. Additionally, we leverage human judgement to demonstrate the effectiveness of using such personality and pragmatics based policy for response generation.

xvOljdhEPhc,Data Augmentation and Learned Layer Aggregation for Improved Multilingual Language Understanding in Dialogue,"Scaling dialogue systems to a multitude of domains, tasks and languages relies on costly and time-consuming data annotation for different domain-task-language configurations. The annotation efforts might be substantially reduced by the methods that generalise well in zero- and few-shot scenarios, and also effectively leverage external unannotated data sources (e.g., Web-scale corpora). We propose two methods to this aim, offering improved dialogue natural language understanding (NLU) across multiple languages: 1) Multi-SentAugment, and 2) LayerAgg. Multi-SentAugment is a self-training method which augments available (typically few-shot) training data with similar (automatically labelled) in-domain sentences from large monolingual Web-scale corpora. LayerAgg learns to select and combine useful semantic information scattered across different layers of a Transformer model (e.g., mBERT); it is especially suited for zero-shot scenarios as semantically richer representations should strengthen the model's cross-lingual capabilities. Applying the two methods with state-of-the-art NLU models obtains consistent improvements across two standard multilingual NLU datasets covering 16 diverse languages. The gains are observed in zero-shot, few-shot, and even in full-data scenarios. The results also suggest that the two methods achieve a synergistic effect: the best overall performance in few-shot setups is attained when the methods are used together.

By leveraging the augmenting data from the GEC models themselves in the post-training process and introducing regularization data for cycle training, our proposed method can effectively improve model robustness of well-trained GEC models with only a few more training epochs as the extra cost. Experiments on four benchmark datasets and seven strong models indicate that our proposed training method can significantly enhance the robustness to four types of attacks without using purposely built adversarial examples in training.

The single matching mechanism model that does not distinguish between the two senses will cause LTSs to be ignored because LTSs are in a weak position. The few-shot learning method that mainly focuses on LTSs is not conducive to grasping the advantage of easy identification of MFSs. This paper proposes a bi-matching mechanism to serve the WSD model to deal with two kinds of senses in a targeted manner, namely definition matching and collocation feature matching. The experiment is carried out under the evaluation framework of English all-words WSD and is better than the baseline models. Moreover, state-of-the-art performance is achieved through data enhancement.",november,True,-11.106744519272524,-10.151381409851329

While advances reported for English using PLMs are unprecedented, reported advances using PLMs for Hebrew are few and far between. The problem is twofold. First, so far, Hebrew resources for training large language models are not of the same magnitude as their English counterparts. Second, there are no accepted benchmarks to evaluate the progress of Hebrew PLMs on, and in particular, sub-word (morphological) tasks. We aim to remedy both aspects. We present AlephBERT, a large PLM for Modern Hebrew, trained on larger vocabulary and a larger dataset than any Hebrew PLM before. Moreover, we introduce a novel language-agnostic architecture that can recover all of the sub-word morphological segments encoded in contextualized word embedding vectors. Based on this new morphological component we offer a new PLM evaluation suite consisting of multiple tasks and benchmarks, that cover sentence level word-level and sub-word level analyses. On all tasks, AlephBERT obtains state-of-the-art results beyond contemporary Hebrew baselines.

Jpl3hYq2CItW,Coloring the Blank Slate: Pre-training Imparts a Hierarchical Inductive Bias to Sequence-to-sequence Models,"Relations between words are governed by hierarchical structure rather than linear ordering. Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, despite their success in downstream NLP applications, often fail to generalize in a hierarchy-sensitive manner when performing syntactic transformations—for example, transforming declarative sentences into questions—instead generalizing linearly using positional surface heuristics. However, syntactic evaluations of seq2seq models have only observed models that were not pre-trained on natural language data before being trained to perform syntactic transformations, in spite of the fact that pre-training has been found to induce hierarchical linguistic generalizations in language models; in other words, the syntactic capabilities of seq2seq models may have been greatly understated. Here, we make use of the pre-trained seq2seq model T5 (and its multilingual variant mT5) and evaluate whether they generalize hierarchically on two syntactic transformations in two languages: question formation and passivization in English and German. We find that T5 and mT5 generalize hierarchically when performing syntactic transformations, whereas non-pre-trained baseline models do not. This result presents additional evidence for the learnability of hierarchical syntactic information from non-annotated natural language text while also demonstrating that seq2seq models are capable of syntactic generalization.",november,True,5.9642371849483355,5.745531916052968

In this paper, we propose to take advantage of transformers to encode different contextualized representations of units of different levels to dynamically capture the information required for discourse dependency analysis on intra- and inter-sentential levels. Motivated by the observation of writing patterns shared across articles to improve discourse analysis, we propose to design sequence labeling methods to take advantage of such structural information from the context that substantially outperforms traditional direct classification methods.

The heavy cognitive load of this task decreases overall annotation quality while inevitably increasing latency. To support annotation efforts, machine-assisted recommenders can sample likely coreferent events for a given target event, thus eliminating the burden of examining large numbers of true negative pairs. However, there has been little to no work in evaluating the effectiveness of recommender approaches, particularly for the task of event coreference. To this end, we first create a simulated version of recommender based annotation for cross document event coreference resolution.

Yet, a common challenge is to build approaches that are effective for niche domains with small text corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called QADA for QA domain adaptation. QADA has two components: (1) A question generation model is used to generate synthetic question-answer samples from the target domain. Different from existing baselines, we enrich the samples via a novel pipeline for data augmentation: for questions, we introduce token-level augmentation (i.e., synonym replacement and token swapping), and, for contexts, we develop hidden-space augmentation which learns to drop context spans via a custom attentive sampling strategy. (2) The QA model is based on transformers. However, unlike existing approaches, we propose to train it via a novel attention-based contrastive adaptation. Here, we use the attention weights to sample informative tokens for discrepancy estimation that helps the QA model separate answers and generalize across source and target domain. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first in QA domain adaptation to leverage data augmentation and attention-based contrastive adaptation. Our evaluation shows that QADA achieves considerable improvements over state-of-the-art baselines for QA domain adaptation.",november,True,-0.4897858423772342,14.629659867984307

We demonstrate that one of the reasons hindering compositional generalization relates to representations being entangled. We propose an extension to sequence-to-sequence models which encourage disentanglement by adaptively re-encoding (at each time step) the source input. Specifically, we condition the source representations on the newly decoded target context which makes it easier for the encoder to exploit specialized information for each prediction rather than capturing it all in a single forward pass. Experimental results on semantic parsing and machine translation empirically show that our proposal delivers more disentangled representations and better generalization.

However, there still remains a large discrepancy between the provided upstream signals and the downstream question-passage relevance, which leads to less improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose the Hyperlink-induced Pre-training (HLP), a method to pre-train the dense retriever with the text relevance induced by hyperlink-based topology within Web documents. We demonstrate that the hyperlink-based structures of dual-link and co-mention can provide effective relevance signals for large-scale pre-training that better facilitate downstream passage retrieval. We investigate the effectiveness of our approach across a wide range of open-domain QA datasets under zero-shot, few-shot, multi-hop, and out-of-domain scenarios. The experiments show our HLP outperforms the BM25 by up to 7 points as well as other pre-training methods by up to 30 points in terms of top-20 retrieval accuracy under the zero-shot scenario.

First, most conventional works only focus on the overall performance of PE but ignore the exact performance of TS, which makes the progress of PE sluggish and less explainable; Second, as no publicly available golden dataset to support in-depth research for TS, almost all of the previous works conduct experiments on their in-house datasets or the noisy datasets built automatically, which makes their experiments hard to be reproduced and compared. To break these limitations mentioned above and spur the research in TS,  we create a benchmark dataset, called \emph{WeTS}, which is a golden corpus annotated by expert translators on four translation directions. Apart from the golden corpus, we also propose several methods to generate synthetic corpus which can be used to improve the performance substantially through pre-training.

Previous works usually adopt heuristic metrics such as the entropy of internal outputs to measure instance difficulty, which suffers from generalization and threshold-tuning. In contrast, learning to exit, or learning to predict instance difficulty is a more appealing way. Though some effort has been devoted to employing such ""learn-to-exit"" modules, it is still unknown whether and how well the instance difficulty can be learned. As a response, we first conduct experiments on the learnability of instance difficulty, which demonstrates that modern neural models perform poorly on predicting instance difficulty. Based on this observation, we propose a simple-yet-effective Hash-based Early Exiting approach HashEE) that replaces the learn-to-exit modules with hash functions to assign each token to a fixed exiting layer. Different from previous methods, HashEE requires no internal classifiers nor extra parameters, and therefore is more efficient.HashEE can be used in various tasks (including language understanding and generation) and model architectures such as seq2seq models.

To alleviate these problems, we propose a pluggable sequence labeling framework, plug-tagger. By switching the task-specific plugin on the input, plug-tagger allows a frozen PLM to perform different sequence labeling tasks without redeployment. Specifically, the plugin on the input are a few continuous vectors, which manipulates the PLM without modifying its parameters, and each task only needs to store the lightweight vectors rather than a full copy of PLM.  To avoid redeployment, we propose the label word mechanism,  which reuses the language model head to prevent task-specific classifiers from modifying model structures.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work so far has investigated how different pre-training objectives affect what BERT learns about linguistics properties. We hypothesize that linguistically motivated objectives (e.g. MLM) should help BERT to acquire better linguistic knowledge compared to using non-linguistically motivated objectives, i.e. hard for humans to guess the association between the input and the label to be predicted. To this end, we pre-train BERT with two linguistically motivated objectives and three non-linguistically motivated ones.

0XOfocEp0u2,A Generative Approach for Mitigating Structural Biases in Natural Language Inference,"Many natural language inference (NLI) datasets contain biases that allow models to perform well by only using a biased subset of the input, without considering the remainder features. For instance, models are able to classify samples by only using the hypothesis, without learning the true relationship between it and the premise.  These structural biases lead discriminative models to learn unintended superficial features and generalize poorly out of the training distribution. In this work, we reformulate the NLI task as a generative task, where a model is conditioned on the biased subset of the input and the label and generates the remaining subset of the input. We show that by imposing a uniform prior, we obtain a provably unbiased model. Through synthetic experiments, we find that this approach is highly robust to large amounts of bias. We then demonstrate empirically on two types of natural bias that this approach leads to fully unbiased models in practice. However, we find that generative models are difficult to train and generally perform worse than discriminative baselines. We highlight the difficulty of the generative modeling task in the context of NLI as a cause for this worse performance. Finally, by fine-tuning the generative model with a discriminative objective, we reduce the performance gap between the generative model and the discriminative baseline, while allowing for a small amount of bias.",november,True,-2.2051322384628316,-7.98265656214694

However, recent probing studies show that these models use spurious correlations and often ignore or focus on wrong evidence to predict labels. To study this issue, we introduce the task of Trustworthy Tabular Reasoning, where a model needs to extract evidence to be used for reasoning, in addition to predicting the label. As a case study, we propose a two-stage sequential prediction approach, which includes an evidence extraction and an inference stage.

However, most of the existing unsupervised text style transfer methods suffer from (i) requiring massive amounts of nonparallel data to guide the transferring of different text styles. (ii) huge performance degradation when fine-tuning the model in new domains. In this work, we propose DAML-ST5, which consists of two parts, DAML and ST5. DAML is a domain adaptive meta-learning approach to refine  general knowledge in multi-heterogeneous source domains, which is capable of adapting to new unseen domains with a small amount data. Moreover, we propose a new  unsupervised TST model Style-T5 (ST5), which is composed of a sequence-to-sequence pre-trained language model T5 and uses style adversarial training for better content preservation and style transfer.

0r3eQftCZUT,Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Common-sense Modulation,"Our world is inherently multimodal and recent work highlights the importance of machine learning models leveraging multiple streams of information in making decisions. Multimodal sentiment analysis has been an active area of research that requires models to take advantage of the linguistic, acoustic, and visual signals available in an utterance. However, most current models do not take into account any social common-sense knowledge which is crucial in how we perceive sentiment in a conversation. To address that, in this paper, we aim to influence or modulate modality representations with common-sense knowledge obtained from a generative social common-sense knowledge base. We provide a novel way to modulate the linguistic, acoustic, and visual features corresponding to an utterance by scaling and shifting these representations. We use the knowledge base to obtain knowledge latent representations for an utterance corresponding to different states of the speaker such as the intent and the reaction, and we use it to shift and scale the three modalities. Our experiments on popular multimodal sentiment analysis benchmark datasets show that our proposed method is on par and often surpasses the current state-of-the art models.",november,True,-25.454653031067416,20.32121388823325

However, content-rich network representation learning and quantifying classiﬁcation uncertainty are challenging when it comes to integrating complex structural dependencies and rich content features at an evidence level. In this paper, we propose an evidential graph representation learning model (EGCN), which can not only fuse network structure and content information into a more complete and powerful representation for each node, but also assess the quality of graph node features to improve classification accuracy. To achieve better fusion, we integrate the node's features representation into structure-aware representation through a delivery operator. Besides, to overcome the difﬁculty of predicting node classification conﬁdence, we employ a novel module based on Dirichlet distribution theory of evidence and subject opinion learning to collect the evidence of the class probabilities.

To learn the domain-invariant knowledge, we replace the conventional adversarial method with novel contrastive regularization to further improve the generalization abilities.

This applies to scenarios such as when a news publisher trains a summarizer on dated news and wants to summarize incoming recent news. In this work, we explore the first application of transductive learning to summarization where we further fine-tune models on test set’s input. Specifically, we construct references for learning from article salient sentences and condition on the randomly masked articles. We show that this approach is also beneficial in the fine-tuning phase when extractive references are jointly predicted with abstractive ones in the training set. In general, extractive references are inexpensive to produce as they are automatically created without human effort. We show that our approach yields state-of-the-art results on CNN/DM and NYT datasets, for instance, more than 1 ROUGE-L points improvement on the former.

This model is able to train on only one language pair and transfers, in a cross-lingual fashion, to low-resource language pairs with negligible degradation in performance. When trained with all language pairs of a large-scale parallel multilingual corpus (OPUS-100), this model achieves the state-of-the-art result on the Tateoba dataset, outperforming an equally-sized previous model by $8.0$ points in accuracy while using less than $0.6\%$ of their parallel data. When finetuned on a single rich-resource language pair, be it English-centered or not, our model is able to match the performance of the ones finetuned on all language pairs under the same data budget with less than $2.0$ points decrease in accuracy. Furthermore, with the same setup, scaling up the number of rich-resource language pairs monotonically improves the performance, reaching a minimum of $0.4$ points discrepancy in accuracy, essentially obviating the need to collect any low-resource parallel data. Finally, we conclude through empirical results and analyses that the performance on the retrieval tasks depends mostly on the monolingual and parallel data size, up to a certain size threshold, rather than on what language pairs are used for training or evaluation.

Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cut-off to similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning, and ignores that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation - a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark.

The softmax output layer of these models typically receives as input a dense feature representation, which has much lower dimensionality than the output. In theory, the result is some words may be impossible to predict via argmax, irrespective of input features, and empirically, this has been shown to happen in small language models (Demeter et al., 2020). In this paper we ask whether it can happen in practical large language models and translation models. To do so, we develop algorithms to detect such unargmaxable tokens in public models. We find that that 13 out of 150 models do indeed have such tokens; however, they are very infrequent and unlikely to impact model quality.

Moreover, adaptive pre-training can harm the PLM's performance on the downstream task by causing catastrophic forgetting of its general knowledge. To overcome such limitations of adaptive pre-training for PLM adaption, we propose a novel domain adaption framework for PLMs coined as Knowledge-Augmented Language model Adaptation (KALA), which modulates the intermediate hidden representations of PLMs with domain knowledge, consisting of entities and their relational facts.

These nodes allow DGMED further construct accurate document-level contextual information, thus accurately extracting multiple events as required.

DKVhbjXs9aG,Composing Structure-Aware Batches for Pairwise Sentence Classification,"Identifying the relation between two sentences requires datasets with pairwise annotations. In many cases, these datasets contain instances that are annotated multiple times as part of different pairs. They constitute a structure that contains additional helpful information about the inter-relatedness of the text instances based on the annotations. This paper investigates how this kind of structural dataset information can be exploited during training. We propose three batch composition strategies to incorporate such information and measure their performance over 14 heterogeneous pairwise sentence classification tasks. Our results show statistically significant improvements (up to 3.9%) - independent of the pre-trained language model - for most tasks compared to baselines that follow a standard training procedure. Further, we see that even this baseline procedure can profit from having such structural information in a low-resource setting.",november,True,11.60085255023562,13.379049665076812

jHjDCY-fvSk,LOPS: Learning Order Inspired Pseudo-Label Selection for Weakly Supervised Text Classification,"Iterative self-training is a popular framework in weakly supervised text classification that involves bootstrapping a deep neural classifier from heuristic pseudo-labels. The quality of pseudo-labels, especially the initial ones, is crucial to final performance but they are inevitably noisy due to their heuristic nature, so selecting the correct ones has a huge potential for performance boost. One straightforward solution is to select samples based on the softmax probability scores corresponding to their pseudo-labels. However, we show through our experiments that such methods are ineffective and unstable due to the erroneously high-confidence predictions from poorly calibrated models. Recent studies on the memorization effects of deep neural models suggest that these models first memorize training samples with clean labels and then those with noisy labels. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel pseudo-label selection method LOPS that takes learning order of samples into consideration. We hypothesize that the learning order reflects the probability of wrong annotation in terms of ranking, and therefore, select the top samples that are learnt earlier. LOPS can be viewed as a strong performance-boost plug-in to most of existing weakly-supervised text classification methods, as confirmed in extensive experiments on six real-world datasets.",november,True,13.258841345379011,2.4568293173161018

The construction of entailment graphs usually suffers from severe sparsity and unreliability of distributional similarity. We propose a two-stage method, Entailment Graph with Textual Entailment and Transitivity (EGT2). EGT2 learns the local entailment relations by recognizing the textual entailment between template sentences formed by typed CCG-parsed predicates. Based on the generated local graph, EGT2 then uses three novel soft transitivity constraints to consider the logical transitivity in entailment structures. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that EGT2 can well model the transitivity in entailment graph to alleviate the sparsity, and leads to signifcant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods.",november,True,-31.58357475819134,2.6891882478158937

The main example would be parent-child relationships between header cells.  Most prior datasets of tables annotated from images or .pdf and most models for extracting table structure concentrate on the problems of table, cell, row, and column bounding box extraction.  The area of fine-grained table structure remains relatively unexplored.   In this study, we present a dataset of 887 tables, manually labeled for cell types and column hierarchy relations.  The tables are selected from IBM FinTabNet, a much larger dataset of more than 100,000 financial tables having cell, row, and column bounding boxes extracted by deep learning, but not including semantic cell type or cell-to-cell relation labels, which we add. Selection of these 887 tables is performed using heuristics which result in a much larger proportion, roughly half, of the selected tables having complex hierarchical structure, than a random sample from FinTabNet. Further, we fine-tune models based on LayoutLM on the cell-type classification task and on the identification of hiearchical relations among column headers.  We achieve F1 scores of 95% and 70% on the respective tasks.  Finally, we use the trained model to create soft labels for the entirety of FinTabNet.

In this work, we make the first exploration to leverage Chinese GPT for pinyin input method. We find that a frozen GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on perfect pinyin. However, the performance drops dramatically when the input includes abbreviated pinyin. A reason is that an abbreviated pinyin can be mapped to many perfect pinyin, which links to even larger amount of Chinese characters. We mitigate this issue with two strategies, including enriching the context with pinyin and optimizing the training process to help distinguish homophones.  To further facilitate the evaluation of pinyin input method, we create a dataset consisting of 270K instances from 15 domains. Results show that our approach improves the performance on abbreviated pinyin across all domains.

In this work we theoretically and empirically that MLM pretraining makes models robust to lexicon-level spurious features, partly answering the question. Our explanation is that MLM pretraining may alleviate problems brought by simplicity bias (Shah et al., 2020), which refers to the phenomenon that a deep model tends to rely excessively on simple features. In NLP tasks, those simple features could be token-level features whose spurious association with the label can be learned easily. We show that MLM pretraining makes learning from the context easier. Thus, pretrained models are less likely to rely excessively on a single token. We also explore the theoretical explanations of MLM’s efficacy in causal settings. Compared with Wei et al.

Dwqav13klH3,Identifying Moments of Change from Longitudinal User Text,"Identifying changes in individuals' behaviour and mood, as observed via content shared on online platforms, is increasingly gaining importance. Most research to-date on this topic focuses on either: (a) identifying individuals at risk or with a certain mental health condition given a batch of posts or (b) providing equivalent labels at the post level. A disadvantage of such work is the lack of a strong temporal component and the inability to make longitudinal assessments following an individual's trajectory and allowing timely interventions. Here we define a new task, that of identifying moments of change in individuals on the basis of their shared content online. The changes we consider are sudden shifts in mood (switches) or gradual mood progression (escalations). We have created detailed guidelines for capturing moments of change and a corpus of 500 manually annotated user timelines (18.7K posts).

We address these issues in two dimensions. First, we introduce MarCQAp, a new modeling approach which encodes the historic answers by adding textual markups in the grounding document text, and then answers the question conditioned on the marked document. Second, we show that sparse self-attention architectures, such as the Longformer, can replace the Transformer, resolving the input length limitation.

In this paper, we first demonstrate that jointly attending multiple positions is not a unique feature of multi-head attention, as multi-layer single-head attention also attends multiple positions. Then, we suggest the main advantage of multi-head attention is the training stability, since it has fewer layers than the single-head attention when attending the same number of positions. Meanwhile, we show that, with recent advances in deep learning, we can successfully stabilize the training of the deep single-head Transformer. As the training difficulty is no longer a bottleneck, substantially deeper single-head Transformers achieve consistent performance improvements.",november,True,23.79729043052342,-8.875545455953839

To address these issues, we enrich the formula information by combining the syntax semantics of the text to construct the math syntax graph, and design the syntax-aware memory networks to deeply fuse the characteristics from the graph and text.  With the help of syntax relations, the token from the text can trace its semantic-related nodes within the formulas, which is able to capture the fine-grained correlations between text and formulas.

These approaches, however, exploit general dialogic corpora (e.g., Reddit) and thus presumably fail to reliably embed domain-specific knowledge useful for concrete downstream TOD domains. In this work, we investigate the effects of domain specialization of pretrained language models (PLMs) for TOD. Within our DS-TOD framework, we first automatically extract salient domain-specific terms, and then use them to construct DomainCC and DomainReddit -- resources that we leverage for domain-specific pretraining, based on (i) masked language modeling (MLM) and (ii) response selection (RS) objectives, respectively. We further propose a resource-efficient and modular domain specialization by means of domain adapters -- additional parameter-light layers in which we encode the domain knowledge. Our experiments with prominent TOD tasks -- dialog state tracking (DST) and response retrieval (RR) -- encompassing five domains from the MultiWOZ benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TOD. Moreover, we show that the light-weight adapter-based specialization (1) performs comparably to full fine-tuning in single domain setups and (2) is particularly suitable for multi-domain specialization, where besides advantageous computational footprint, it can offer better downstream performance.",november,True,-2.3427206325478025,-15.454697372728875

wXRPHXseNg3,WLASL-LEX: a Dataset for Recognising Phonological Properties in American Sign Language,"Signed Language Processing (SLP) concerns the automated processing of signed languages, the main means of communication of Deaf and hearing impaired individuals. SLP features many different tasks, ranging from sign recognition to translation and production of signed speech, but has been overlooked by the NLP community thus far. In this paper, we bring to attention the task of modelling the phonology of sign languages. We leverage existing resources to construct a large-scale dataset of American Sign Language signs annotated with six different phonological properties. We then conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether data-driven end-to-end and feature-based approaches can be optimised to automatically recognise these properties. We find that, despite the inherent challenges of the task, graph-based neural networks that operate over skeleton features extracted from raw videos are able to succeed at the task to a varying degree. Most importantly, we show that this performance pertains even on signs unobserved during training. ",november,True,15.099924531659138,-19.691046494920872

Therefore we explore the problem using free-text medical notes recorded in electronic health records (EHR). MIMIC III is a de-identified EHR database containing observations from over 40,000 patients in critical care units. Since the text corpus is unstructured in the non-database table format, existing machine learning models may be ineffective at interpreting the results, which is often desirable for clinical diagnosis. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a text mining and pattern discovery solution to discover strong association patterns from patient discharge summaries and the code of international classification of diseases (ICD9-code). The proposed approach offers a straightforward interpretation of the underlying relation of patient characteristics in an unsupervised machine learning setting. The clustering results outperform the baseline clustering algorithm and are comparable to baseline supervised methods.",november,True,-4.114964050330745,23.85571582163223
RhhZo7CpksR,$AmbiPun$ : Generating Humorous Puns with Ambiguous Context,"Computational humor has garnered interest of the natural language processing community due to its wide applications to real world scenarios. One way to express humor is via the use of puns. A homographic pun plays on words that are spelled the same way but have different meanings. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to generate pun sentences that does not require any pun sentences to train on. Our approach is inspired by humor theories that ambiguity comes from the context rather than the pun word itself. Given a pair of definitions of a pun word, our model first produces a list of related concepts through a reverse dictionary. We then utilize one-shot GPT3 to generate context words, and then generate punning sentences that incorporate context words from both worlds. We also investigate how the position of a pun word appearing in the sentence will influence the generated results. We compare our proposed $\textsc{AmbiPun}$ with well crafted baselines. Human evaluation shows that our method successfully generates pun 52% of the time, outperforming the the state-of-the-art model by a large margin.

1GZzXcmivZ4,Non-Parametric Domain Adaptation for End-to-End Speech Translation,"The end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST) has received increasing attention due to the potential of its less error propagation, lower latency, and fewer parameters. However, the effectiveness of neural-based approaches to this task is severely limited by the available training corpus, especially for domain adaptation where in-domain triplet training data is scarce or nonexistent. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric method that leverages domain-specific text translation corpus to achieve domain adaptation for the E2E-ST system. To this end, we first incorporate an additional encoder into the pre-trained E2E-ST model to realize text translation modeling and then unify the decoder's output representation for text and speech translation tasks by reducing the correspondent representation mismatch in available triplet training data. During domain adaptation, a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) classifier is introduced to produce the final translation distribution using the external datastore built by the domain-specific text translation corpus, while the universal output representation is adopted to perform a similarity search. Experiments on the Europarl-ST benchmark demonstrate that when in-domain text translation data is used only, our proposed approach significantly improves the baseline by 12.82 BLEU on average in all translation directions.",november,True,19.63793883056215,-20.417278102278647

uWvW_Z4P8f,Can Rationalization Improve Robustness?,"A growing line of work has investigated the development of neural NLP models that can produce rationales---subsets of input that can explain their model predictions. In this paper, we ask whether such rationale models can also provide robustness to adversarial attacks in addition to their interpretable nature. Since these models need to first generate rationales (``rationalizer'') before making predictions (``predictor''), they have the potential to ignore noise or adversarially added text by simply masking it out of the generated rationale. To this end, we systematically generate various types of `AddText' attacks for both token and sentence-level rationalization tasks, and perform an extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art rationale models across five different tasks. Our experiments reveal that the rationale models show the promise to improve robustness, while they struggle in certain scenarios---when the rationalizer is sensitive to positional bias or lexical choices of attack text. Further, leveraging human rationale as supervision does not always translate to better performance. Our study is a first step towards exploring the interplay between interpretability and robustness in the rationalize-then-predict framework.",november,True,-1.5055473754163535,-4.484672955249725

sagXUkJ1fDn,Softmax Bottleneck Makes Language Models Unable to Represent Multi-mode Word Distributions,"Neural language models (LMs) such as GPT-2 estimate the probability distribution over the next word by a softmax over the vocabulary. The softmax layer produces the distribution based on the dot products of a single hidden state and the embeddings of words in the vocabulary. However, we discover that this single hidden state cannot produce all probability distributions regardless of the LM size or training data size because the single hidden state embedding cannot be close to the embeddings of all the possible next words simultaneously when there are other interfering word embeddings between them. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of this limitation both theoretically and practically.  Our work not only deepens our understanding of softmax bottleneck and mixture of softmax (MoS) but also inspires us to propose multi-facet softmax (MFS) to address the limitations of MoS. Extensive empirical analyses confirm our findings and show that against MoS, the proposed MFS achieves two-fold improvements in the perplexity of GPT-2 and BERT.",november,True,-3.157499385607186,-16.755246624952875

TS3flrd9wWY,Language-Family Adapters for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Massively multilingual pretrained models yield state-of-the-art results in a wide range of cross-lingual natural language processing tasks. For machine translation, the de facto way to leverage knowledge of pretrained models is fine-tuning on parallel data from one or multiple language pairs. Multilingual fine-tuning improves performance on medium- and low-resource languages but requires modifying the entire model and can be prohibitively expensive. Training either language-pair specific or language-agnostic adapters while keeping most of the pretrained model's parameters frozen has been proposed as a lightweight alternative. However, the former do not learn useful cross-lingual representations for multiple language pairs, while the latter share parameters for all languages and potentially have to deal with negative interference. In this paper, we propose training language-family adapters on top of a pretrained multilingual model to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. Using language families, our model consistently outperforms other adapter-based approaches and is on par with multilingual fine-tuning, while being more efficient. We also demonstrate that language-family adapters provide an effective method to translate to languages unseen during pretraining and substantially outperform the baselines.",november,True,9.439426159658558,-23.37438361403719

But dominant KGE models often fail in zero-shot relational learning because they cannot learn effective representations for unseen relations. Previous studies mainly separately utilize the textual description of relation and its neighbor relations to represent unseen relations. In fact, the semantics of a relation can be expressed by three kinds of graphs: factual graph, ontology graph and textual description graph, and they can complement and enhance each other. Therefore, to obtain more accurate representation of relation in zero-shot learning, we propose the mixture-of-graphs (MoG) experts to improve the effect of current KGE for unseen relations. We build multi-aspect associations between seen and unseen relations which will be used directly to guide previous KGE methods such as TransE and RotatE on zero-shot relational learning.

It would be desirable if models can acquire some prompting knowledge before task adaptation. We present the Unified Prompt Tuning (UPT) framework, leading to better few-shot learning for BERT-style models by explicitly capturing prompting semantics from non-target NLP datasets. In UPT, a novel paradigm Prompt-Options-Verbalizer is proposed for joint prompt learning across different NLP tasks, forcing PLMs to capture task-invariant prompting knowledge. We further design a self-supervised task named Knowledge-enhanced Selective Masked Language Modeling to improve the PLM's generalization abilities for accurate adaptation to previously unseen tasks. After multi-task learning, the PLM can be fine-tuned for any target few-shot NLP tasks using the same prompting paradigm.

FEEUqSmmrtZ,Text-to-Table: A New Way of Information Extraction,"We study a new problem setting of information extraction (IE), referred to as text-to-table. In text-to-table, given a text, one creates a table or several tables expressing the main content of the text, while the model is learned from text-table pair data. The problem setting differs from those of the existing methods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to large tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas.  As far as we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem.  We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to perform the task.  We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach, exploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and table relation embeddings. We consider text-to-table as an inverse problem of the well-studied table-to-text, and make use of four existing table-to-text datasets in our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that the vanilla seq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation extraction and named entity extraction.

iAG3ldh1T8g,Invariant Language Modeling,"Modern pretrained language models are critical components of NLP pipelines.  Yet, they suffer from spurious correlations, poor out-of-domain generalization, and biases. Inspired by recent progress in causal machine learning, in particular the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm, we propose invariant language modeling, a framework for learning invariant representations that generalize better across multiple environments. In particular, we adapt a game-theoretic implementation of IRM (IRM-games) to language models, where the invariance emerges from a specific training schedule in which all the environments compete to optimize their own environment-specific loss by updating subsets of the model in a round-robin fashion. In a series of controlled experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our method to (i) remove structured noise, (ii) ignore specific spurious correlations without affecting global performance, and (iii) achieve better out-of-domain generalization. These benefits come with a negligible computational overhead compared to standard training, do not require changing the local loss, and can be applied to any language model architecture.

We map words that have a common WordNet hypernym to the same class and train large neural LMs by gradually annealing from predicting the class to token prediction during training. Empirically, this curriculum learning strategy consistently improves perplexity over various large, highly-performant state-of-the-art Transformer-based models on two datasets, WikiText-103 and Arxiv.

O2BGw7qupHl,ASSIST: Towards Label Noise-Robust Dialogue State Tracking,"The MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset has greatly boosted the research on dialogue state tracking (DST). However, substantial noise has been discovered in its state annotations. Such noise brings about huge challenges for training DST models robustly. Although several refined versions, including MultiWOZ 2.1-2.4, have been published recently, there are still lots of noisy labels, especially in the training set. Besides, it is costly to rectify all the problematic annotations. In this paper, instead of improving the annotation quality further, we propose a general framework, named ASSIST (lAbel noiSe-robuSt dIalogue State Tracking), to train DST models robustly from noisy labels. ASSIST first generates pseudo labels for each sample in the training set by using an auxiliary model trained on a small clean dataset, then puts the generated pseudo labels and vanilla noisy labels together to train the primary model. We show the validity of ASSIST theoretically. Experimental results also demonstrate that ASSIST improves the joint goal accuracy of DST by up to $28.16\%$ on the initial version MultiWOZ 2.0 and $8.41\%$ on the latest version MultiWOZ 2.4, respectively.

IZreMhYT8gW,Can Explanations Be Useful for Calibrating Black Box Models?,"One often wants to take an existing, trained NLP model and use it on data from a new domain. While fine-tuning or few-shot learning can be used to adapt the base model, there is no one simple recipe to getting these working; moreover, one may not have access to the original model weights if it is deployed as a black box. To this end, we study how to improve a black box model's performance on a new domain given examples from the new domain by leveraging explanations of the model's behavior. Our approach first extracts a set of features combining human intuition about the task with model attributions generated by black box interpretation techniques, and then uses a simple model to calibrate or rerank the model's predictions based on the features. We experiment with our method on two tasks, extractive question answering and natural language inference, covering adaptation from several pairs of domains. The experimental results across all the domain pairs show that explanations are useful for calibrating these models. We show that the calibration features transfer to some extent between tasks and shed light on how to effectively use them.",november,True,0.9520430047164614,-11.075163400277303

However, existing resources only covering a small number of activities, limiting its practical usefulness. In this work, we propose a zero-shot learning approach to script parsing, the task of tagging texts with pre-defined, scenario-specific event and participant types, which makes it possible to acquire script knowledge without domain-specific annotations. We (1) learn representations of potential event and participant mentions by promoting cluster consistency according to the annotated data; (2) perform clustering on the event / participant candidates from unannotated texts that belongs to an unseen scenario. We further exploit dependency and coreference information. The model achieves 68.1/74.4 average F1 for event / participant parsing, respectively, outperforming a previous CRF model that has access to domain-specific supervision.",november,True,3.2466654337578844,9.974140307699127

However, current linguistic diversity scores rely mostly on measures such as the number of languages in the sample, which are not very informative about the structural properties of languages. In this paper, we propose a score derived from the distribution of text statistics (mean word length) as a linguistic attribute suitable for cross-linguistic comparison. We compare NLP data sets (UD, Bible100. mBERT, XTREME, XGLUE, XNLI, XCOPA, TyDiQA, XQuAD) to a new data set designed specifically for the purpose of being typologically representative (WALS-SC). To do so, we apply a version of the Jaccard index ($J_{mm}$) suitable for comparing sets of measures. This diversity score can identify the types of languages that need to be included in multilingual data sets in order to reach broad linguistic coverage. We find, for example, that (poly)synthetic languages are missing in almost all data sets. ",november,True,6.9376363479403516,-30.764236082027182

In order to equip NLP systems with this selective answering capability, several task-specific approaches have been proposed. However, which approaches work best across tasks or even if they consistently outperform the simplest baseline `MaxProb' remains to be explored. To this end, we systematically study `selective prediction' in a large-scale setup of 17 datasets across several NLP tasks. Through comprehensive experiments under in-domain (IID), out-of-domain (OOD), and adversarial (ADV) settings, we show that despite leveraging additional resources (held-out data/computation), none of the existing approaches consistently and considerably outperforms MaxProb in all three settings. Furthermore, their performance does not translate well across tasks. For instance, 'Monte-Carlo Dropout' outperforms all other approaches on Duplicate Detection datasets but does not fare well on NLI datasets, especially in the OOD setting. Thus, we recommend that future selective prediction approaches should be evaluated across tasks and settings for reliable estimation of their capabilities.",november,True,0.9800491515965104,-5.949288447297784

Nonetheless, virtually all prompt-based methods are token-level, meaning they all utilize GPT's left-to-right language model or BERT's masked language model to perform cloze-style tasks. In this paper, we attempt to accomplish several NLP tasks in the zero-shot scenario using a BERT original pre-training task abandoned by RoBERTa and other models—Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). Unlike token-level techniques, our sentence-level prompt-based method NSP-BERT does not need to fix the length of the prompt or the position to be predicted, allowing it to handle tasks such as entity linking with ease. Based on the characteristics of NSP-BERT, we offer several quick building templates for various downstream tasks. We suggest a two-stage prompt method for word sense disambiguation tasks in particular. Our samples-contrast method for mapping the labels significantly enhance the model's performance on sentence-pair tasks. On the Chinese benchmark FewCLUE, our NSP-BERT outperforms other zero-shot methods on most of these tasks and comes close to the few-shot methods. And on GLUE and other English datasets NSP-BERT is still competitive. Our code will be available on github.",november,True,-2.8848260290815677,-24.739238852930676

However, for most language pairs there's a shortage of parallel documents, although parallel sentences are readily available. In this paper, we study whether and how contextual modeling in DocNMT is transferable via multilingual modeling. We focus on the scenario of zero-shot transfer from teacher languages with document level data to student languages with no documents but sentence level data, and for the first time treat document-level translation as a transfer learning problem. Using simple concatenation-based DocNMT, we explore the effect of 3 factors on the transfer: the number of teacher languages with document level data, the balance between document and sentence level data at training, and the data type of  document level data (genuine vs. back-translated). Our experiments on Europarl-7 and IWSLT-10 show the feasibility of multilingual transfer for DocNMT, particularly on document-specific metrics. We observe that more teacher languages and adequate data schedule both contribute to better transfer quality. Surprisingly, the transfer is less sensitive to the data type, where multilingual DocNMT delivers decent performance with either back-translated or genuine document pairs.",november,True,37.724795357202346,-19.01658694995372

Earlier work has explored either plug-and-play decoding strategies, or more powerful but blunt approaches such as prompting. There hence currently exists a trade-off between fine-grained control, and the capability for more expressive high-level instructions. To alleviate this trade-off, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture that enables intermediate text prompts at arbitrary time steps.

0Wky3xP0347,SalesBot: Transitioning from Chit-Chat to Task-Oriented Dialogues,"Dialogue systems are usually categorized into two types, open-domain and task-oriented. The first one focuses on chatting with users and making them engage in the conversations, where selecting a proper topic to fit the dialogue context is essential for a successful dialogue.  The other one focuses on a specific task instead of casual talks, e.g., finding a movie on Friday night, playing a song. These two directions have been studied separately due to their different purposes. However, how to smoothly transition from social chatting to task-oriented dialogues is important for triggering the business opportunities, and there is no any public data focusing on such scenarios. Hence, this paper focuses on investigating the conversations starting from open-domain social chatting and then gradually transitioning to task-oriented purposes, and releases a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations for encouraging this research direction. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a framework to automatically generate many dialogues without human involvement, in which any powerful open-domain dialogue generation model can be easily leveraged. The human evaluation shows that our generated dialogue data has a natural flow at a reasonable quality, showing that our released data has a great potential of guiding future research directions and commercial activities. Furthermore, the released models allow researchers to automatically generate unlimited dialogues in the target scenarios, which can greatly benefit semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches.",november,True,-12.22582403885135,16.010325620943767

However, a major limitation of existing works is that they ignore the interrelation between spans (pairs). In this work, we propose a novel span representation approach, named Packed Levitated Markers (PL-Marker),  to consider the interrelation between the spans (pairs) by strategically packing the markers in the encoder. In particular, we propose a neighborhood-oriented packing strategy, which  considers the neighbor spans integrally to better model the entity boundary information. Furthermore, for those more complicated span pair classification tasks, we  design a subject-oriented packing strategy, which packs each subject and all its objects to model the interrelation between the same-subject span pairs. The experimental results show that, with the enhanced marker feature, our model advances baselines on six NER benchmarks, and obtains a 3.5%-3.6% strict relation F1 improvement with higher speed over previous state-of-the-art models on ACE04 and ACE05.

Dynamic adversarial data collection (DADC), where annotators craft examples that challenge continually improving models, holds promise as an approach for generating such diverse training sets. Prior work has shown that running DADC over 1-3 rounds can help models fix some error types, but it does not necessarily lead to better generalization beyond adversarial test data. We argue that running DADC over many rounds maximizes its training-time benefits, as the different rounds can together cover many of the task-relevant phenomena. We present the first study of longer-term DADC, where we collect 20 rounds of NLI examples for a small set of premise paragraphs, with both adversarial and non-adversarial approaches. Models trained on DADC examples make 26% fewer errors on our expert-curated test set compared to models trained on non-adversarial data.

Our approach consists of 1) a method for training data generators to generate high-quality, label-consistent data samples; and 2) a filtering mechanism for removing data points that contribute to spurious correlations, measured in terms of z-statistics. We generate debiased versions of the SNLI and MNLI datasets, and we evaluate on a large suite of debiased, out-of-distribution, and adversarial test sets. Results show that models trained on our debiased datasets generalise significantly better than those trained on the original datasets in all settings.

-J2Pefs3cw,Textual Entailment with Dynamic Contrastive Learning for Zero-shot NER,"In this paper, we study the problem of zero-shot NER, which aims at building a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system from scratch. It needs to identify the entities in the given sentences when we have zero token-level annotations for training. Previous works usually use sequential labeling models to solve the NER task and obtain weakly labeled data from entity dictionaries in the zero-shot setting. However, these labeled data are quite noisy since we need the labels for each token and the entity coverage of the dictionaries is limited. Here we propose to formulate the NER task as a Textual Entailment problem and solve the task via Textual Entailment with Dynamic Contrastive Learning (TEDC). TEDC not only alleviates the noisy labeling issue, but also transfers the knowledge from pre-trained textual entailment models. Additionally, the dynamic contrastive learning framework contrasts the entities and non-entities in the same sentence and improves the model's discrimination ability. Experiments on two datasets show that TEDC can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the task of zero-shot NER.",november,True,-28.63067566996663,-7.0780234966471465

pJeVcX8_Et,Predictive text for agglutinative and polysynthetic languages,"This paper presents a set of experiments in the area of morphological modelling and  predictioning. We examine the tasks of segmentation and predictive text entry for two under-resourced and indigenous languages, K'iche' and Chukchi. We use different segmentation methods to make datasets for language modelling and then train models of different types: single-way segmented, which are trained using data from one segmentor; two-way segmented, which are trained using concatenated data from two segmentors; and finetuned, which are trained on two datasets from different segmentors. We  measure word and character level perplexities of the language models and find that single-way segmented models trained using morphologically segmented data and finetuned models work the best. Finally, we test the language models on the task of predictive text entry using gold standard data and measure the average number of clicks per character and keystroke savings rate. We find that the models trained using morphologically segmented data work better, although with substantial room for improvement. At last, we propose the usage of morphological segmentation in order to improve the end-user experience while using predictive text and we plan on testing this assumption by training other models and experimenting on more languages.",november,True,5.561728966175887,-27.097100684155674

However, such models have been shown to be more prone to hallucinate facts that are unfaithful to the input context.  In this paper, we propose a method to remedy entity-level extrinsic hallucinations with Entity Coverage Control (ECC).  We first compute entity coverage precision and prepend the corresponding control code for each training example, which implicitly guides the model to recognize faithfulness contents in the training phase. We further extend our method via intermediate fine-tuning on large but noisy data extracted from Wikipedia to unlock zero-shot summarization.

Given multiple documents on a super event, it aims to mine a series of salient events in a temporal order. For example, the event chain of super event Mexico Earthquake in 2017 is {earthquake hit Mexico, destroy houses, kill people, block roads}. This task can help readers capture the gist of texts quickly, thereby improving reading efficiency and deepening text comprehension. To address this task, we regard an event as a cluster of different mentions of similar meanings. In this way, we can identify the different expressions of events, enrich their semantic knowledge and enhance order information among them. Taking events as the basic unit, we propose a novel and flexible unsupervised framework, EMiner. Specifically, we extract event mentions from texts and merge those of similar meanings into a cluster as an event. Then, essential events are selected and arranged into a chain in the order of their occurrences. We then develop a testbed for the proposed task, including a human-annotated benchmark and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of EMiner in terms of both automatic and human evaluations.",november,True,-12.803595854571578,32.38942614341088

To alleviate these issues, we propose BORT, a back and denoising reconstruction approach for end-to-end task-oriented dialog system. To improve the accuracy of dialog state that is essential for the task completion of dialog system, back reconstruction is used to reconstruct the original input context from the generated dialogue state since the inaccurate dialog state cannot recover its corresponding input context. To enhance the antinoise capability of the model, denosing reconstruction is used to reconstruct the corrupted dialog state and response.

At the data level, ST-SQL performs data expansion by using an iterative framework to attach pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. The expanded data are sampled to reversely train the model. At the algorithm level, ST-SQL defines a column specificity to perform a more fine-grained gradient update during meta-training.

Our model explicitly overcomes the restriction of both domain and language usage via language alignment and contrastive training. Moreover, we develop an adversarial augmentation mechanism to further enhance the robustness of low-resource rumor representation.

We measure reduction in processing effort using two surprisal-based measures and estimate surprisal with an adaptive neural language model. Our findings suggest that human-like patterns of repetitions can be learned implicitly by utterance generation models equipped with psycholinguistically motivated surprisal-based objectives and adaptation mechanisms.

KGEs typically create an embedding for each entity in the graph, which results in large model sizes on real-world graphs with millions of entities.

We show that an off-the-shelf encoder-decoder Transformer model can serve as a scalable and versatile KGE model obtaining state-of-the-art results for KG link prediction and KGQA. We achieve this by posing KG link prediction as a sequence-to-sequence task and exchange the triple scoring approach taken by prior KGE methods with a generative decoding approach. Such a simple but powerful method reduces the model size up to 90% compared to conventional KGE models and attains the best performance among small-sized models.

Our agent first generates a textual description of the demonstrated unseen task, then leverages this description to replicate it. Through multiple evaluation scenarios and a suite of generalization tests, we find that agents that perform text-based inference are better equipped for the challenge under a random split of tasks.

Although previous methods have made great success on DEE, they are limited by two bottlenecks: losing focus and losing the connection. In this paper, to break through the above bottlenecks, we annotated a new dataset, named WIKIEVENT++, towards focused and connected DEE.  Besides, we propose two different models to approach this task: the extractive model and the generative model. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Taking inspiration from monolingual speakers exploring new languages using bilingual dictionaries, we investigate the applicability of bilingual dictionaries for languages with extremely low, or no bilingual corpus. In this paper, we explore methods using bilingual dictionaries with an NMT model to improve translations for extremely low resource languages. We extend this work for multilingual systems, exhibiting zero-shot property.

In this work, we propose a History Information Enhanced text-to-SQL model (HIE-SQL) to exploit context dependence information from both history utterances and the last predicted SQL query. In view of the mismatch, we treat natural language and SQL as two modalities and propose a bimodal pre-trained model to bridge the gap between them. Besides, we design a schema-linking graph to enhance connections from utterances and the SQL query to database schema.

Sampling is a promising bottom-up method for probing, but generating samples from successful models like BERT remains challenging. Taking inspiration from theories of iterated learning in cognitive science, we explore the use of serial reproduction chains to probe BERT's priors. Although the masked language modeling objective does not guarantee a consistent joint distribution, we observe that a unique and consistent estimator of the ground-truth joint distribution may be obtained by a GSN sampler, which randomly selects which word to mask and reconstruct on each step. We compare the lexical and syntactic statistics of sentences from the resulting prior distribution against those of the ground-truth corpus distribution and elicit a large empirical sample of naturalness judgments to investigate how, exactly, the model deviates from human speakers.

However, current techniques rely on training a perturbation model for every targeted attribute, which is expensive and hard to generalize. We present Tailor, a semantically-controlled text generation system. Tailor builds on a pretrained seq2seq model, and produces textual outputs conditioning on $\textbf{control codes}$ derived from semantic representations. We craft a set of operations to modify the control codes, which in turn steer generation towards targeted attributes. These operations can be further composed into higher-level ones, allowing for flexible perturbation strategies. Tailor can be applied in various scenarios. We use it to automatically create high-quality contrast sets for four distinct natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These contrast sets contain fewer spurious biases and are complementary to manually annotated ones in terms of lexical diversity. We show that Tailor helps improve model generalization through data augmentation, with a 5.8-point gain on an NLI challenge set, by perturbing just $\sim2\%$ of training data.",november,True,11.523841791193485,-9.112034376636673

The dominant code search paradigm is to learn the semantic matching between code snippets and queries by neural networks. However, this search paradigm causes the gap transferring and expansion between code snippets and queries because researchers utilize pairs of code snippets and code descriptions (e.g., comments and documentation) to train their models and evaluate the trained models on the query which is different from the code description in writing style and application scenario. To remedy the issue, we propose a new simple but effective search paradigm, Query2Desc, which entirely depends on natural language and conducts code search by performing the semantic matching between code descriptions and queries. Experimental results on dataset CoSQA show that the state-of-the-art model CodeBERT gets improvement of 17.48\% in terms of the average MRR when applying it on Query2Desc.

Recently, ED without triggers has been proposed and gained benefits since it relieves the tedious effort of data labeling.  However, it still suffers from several formidable challenges: multi-label, insufficient clues, and imbalanced event types.  We, therefore, propose a novel Derangement Question-Answering (DQA) framework on top of BERT to tackle the above challenges.  More specially, we treat the input text as a {\em question} and directly concatenate it with all event types, who are deemed as {\em answers}. Thus, by utilizing the original information, we can facilitate the power of self-attention in BERT to absorb the semantic relation between the original input text and the event types.  Moreover, we design a simple yet effective {\em derangement} mechanism to relieve the issue of imbalanced event types.  By including such perturbation, we can train a more robust model to promote the semantic information in the major events while recording the position of the minor events than the vanilla QA framework.  The empirical results show that: (1) our proposed DQA framework attains state-of-the-art performance over previous competitive models. (2) Our model can automatically link the triggers with the event types while signifying the corresponding arguments. ",november,True,-15.717810901479734,35.21801429188955

Introducing human attention is a classical method, but it needs a high cost of manual labeling. This paper proposes a perturbation-based self-supervised attention approach to guide attention learning without any annotation overheads. Specifically, we add as much noise as possible to all the words in the sentence simultaneously while without changing their semantics and predictions. According to the words that tolerate more noise are supposed to be less significant, we can obtain attention supervision information and utilize it to refine the attention distribution. Experimental results on three text classification tasks show that our approach can significantly promote the performance of current attention-based models and is more effective than existing self-supervised methods.

We address this issue by identifying relevant passages based on whether they are useful for a trained QA model to arrive at the correct answers, and develop a search process guided by the QA model's loss. Our experiments show that this approach enables identifying relevant context for  unseen data greater than 90% of the time on the IIRC dataset and generalizes better to the end QA task than those trained on just the gold retrieval data on IIRC and QASC datasets.

In this work, we propose a new formulation -- accumulated prediction sensitivity, which measures fairness in machine learning models based on the model's prediction sensitivity to perturbations in input features. The metric attempts to quantify the extent to which a single prediction depends on a protected attribute, where the protected attribute encodes the membership status of an individual in a protected group.          We show that the metric can be theoretically linked with a specific notion of group fairness (statistical parity) and individual fairness. It also correlates well with humans' perception of fairness. We conduct experiments on two text classification datasets -- Jigsaw Toxicity, and Bias in Bios, and evaluate the correlations between metrics and manual annotations on whether the model produced a fair outcome.

It is therefore necessary for the model to learn novel relational patterns with very few labeled data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous task knowledge. In this paper, we formulate this challenging yet practical problem as continual few-shot relation learning (CFRL). Based on the finding that learning for new emerging few-shot tasks often results in feature distributions that are incompatible with previous tasks' learned distributions, we propose a novel method based on embedding space regularization and data augmentation. Our method generalizes to new few-shot tasks and avoids catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks by enforcing extra constraints on the relational embeddings and by adding extra {relevant} data in a self-supervised manner.

JCipWpsW6R,Composable Sparse Fine-Tuning for Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Fine-tuning the entire set of parameters of a large pretrained model has become the mainstream approach for transfer learning. To increase its efficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting and interference, techniques like adapters and sparse fine-tuning have been developed. Adapters are modular, as they can be combined to adapt a model towards different facets of knowledge (e.g., dedicated language and/or task adapters). Sparse fine-tuning is expressive, as it controls the behavior of all model components. In this work, we introduce a new fine-tuning method with both these desirable properties. In particular, we learn sparse, real-valued masks based on a simple variant of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. Task-specific masks are obtained from annotated data in a source language, and language-specific masks from masked language modeling in a target language. Both these masks can then be composed with the pretrained model. Unlike adapter-based fine-tuning, this method neither increases the number of parameters at inference time nor alters the original model architecture. Most importantly, it outperforms adapters in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer by a large margin in a series of multilingual benchmarks, including Universal Dependencies, MasakhaNER, and AmericasNLI. Based on an in-depth analysis, we additionally find that sparsity is crucial to prevent both 1) interference between the fine-tunings to be composed and 2) overfitting.

EHRs contain patient records, stored in structured tables as well as unstructured clinical notes. The information in structured and unstructured EHR records is not strictly disjoint: information may be duplicated, contradictory, or provide additional context between these sources. This presents a rich opportunity to study question answering (QA) models that combine reasoning over both structured and unstructured data. Additionally, we propose a novel methodology that automatically generates a large QA dataset by retrieving answers from both structured and unstructured EHR records.

To address this issue, we propose Masked Label Smoothing (MLS), a new mechanism that masks the soft label probability of source-side words to zero.

W4Czw9mxKuQ,Learning Scalable Representation for Source Code,"This paper presents a scalable distributed code representation (SDCR) learning technique, which addresses the most common sparsity and out-of-vocabulary (OoV) concerns simultaneously. We introduce abstract syntax tree (AST) to reflect the structural information of code snippet and adopt the well-recognized 'bag of AST paths' as its intermediate representation, so that the unique structural and syntactic information of programs can be captured. Our proposed SDCR is supported by two core pillars. First, we provide comprehensive empirical study showing that only 1% of the AST paths can account for approximately 75% of the AST path occurrences. That is, dropping most of unnecessary AST paths still allows SDCR to perform well. Second, all AST paths (without leaf nodes in AST) are made up of a limited number of descriptive path elements, for which a lightweight encoder may produce a good embedding of any AST path. Incorporating these two pillars enables us to represent code snippets with better generalizability and scalability. Based on extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we show that our SDCR have superior performance against the state-of-the-art with nearly 40% reduction in the number of model parameters.",november,True,3.157807499400686,4.9734223595269444

5Q-ihWzhSi,"AMRize, then Parse! Enhancing AMR Parsing with PseudoAMR Data","As Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) implicitly involves compound semantic annotations, we hypothesize auxiliary tasks which are semantically or formally related can better enhance AMR parsing. With carefully designed control experiments, we find that 1) Semantic role labeling (SRL) and dependency parsing (DP), would bring much more significant performance gain than unrelated tasks in the text-to-AMR transition. 2) To make a better fit for AMR, data from auxiliary tasks should be properly ""AMRized'' to PseudoAMR before training. 3) Intermediate-task training paradigm outperforms multitask learning when introducing auxiliary tasks to AMR parsing. From an empirical perspective, we propose a principled method to choose, reform, and train auxiliary tasks to boost AMR parsing. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and few-shots benchmarks of AMR parsing.",november,True,3.9051810107566918,4.398333136477269

H8L5q6lcWqM,Divide and Rule: Effective Pre-Training for Context-Aware Multi-Encoder Translation Models,"Multi-encoder models are a broad family of context-aware neural machine translation systems that aims to improve translation quality by encoding document-level contextual information alongside the current sentence. The context encoding is undertaken by contextual parameters, trained on document-level data. In this work, we discuss the difficulty of training these parameters effectively, due to the sparsity of the words in need of context (i.e., the training signal), and their relevant context. We propose to pre-train the contextual parameters over split sentence pairs, which makes an efficient use of the available data for two reasons. Firstly, it increases the contextual training signal by breaking intra-sentential syntactic relations, and thus pushing the model to search the context for disambiguating clues more frequently. Secondly, it eases the retrieval of relevant context, since context segments become shorter. We propose four different splitting methods, and evaluate our approach with BLEU and contrastive test sets. Results show that it consistently improves learning of contextual parameters, both in low and high resource settings.",november,True,21.972851513659574,-13.668719278001761

Further, we show that this transfer can be achieved by training over a collection of low-resource languages that are typologically similar (but phylogenetically unrelated) to the target language. In our experiments, we transfer from a collection of 10 Indigenous American languages (AmericasNLP, Mager et al., 2021) to K'iche', a Mayan language. We compare our multilingual model to a monolingual (from-scratch) baseline, as well as a model pre-trained on Quechua only. We show that the multilingual pre-trained approach yields consistent segmentation quality across target dataset sizes, exceeding the monolingual baseline in 6/10 experimental settings. Our model yields especially strong results at small target sizes, including a zero-shot performance of 20.6 F1.

CRBzhRdkycU,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Entity Alignment,"Embedding-based methods have attracted increasing attention in recent entity alignment (EA) studies. Although great promise they can offer, there are still several limitations. The most notable is that they identify the aligned entities based on cosine similarity, ignoring the semantics underlying the embeddings themselves. Furthermore, these methods are shortsighted, heuristically selecting the closest entity as the target and allowing multiple entities to match the same candidate. To address these limitations, we model entity alignment as a sequential decision-making task, in which an agent sequentially decides whether two entities are matched or mismatched based on their representation vectors. The proposed reinforcement learning (RL)-based entity alignment framework can be flexibly adapted to most embedding-based EA methods.

To tackle this problem, we represent complex real-world privacy leakage scenarios under a universal parameterization, \textit{Knowledge, Anonymization, Resource, and Target} (KART). KART parameterization has two merits: (i) it clarifies the definition of privacy leakage in each experiment and (ii) it improves the comparability of the findings of risk assessments. We show that previous studies can be simply reviewed by parameterizing the scenarios with KART. We also demonstrate privacy risk assessments in different scenarios under the same attack method, which suggests that KART helps approximate the upper bound of risk under a specific attack or scenario. We believe that KART helps integrate past and future findings on privacy risk and will contribute to a standard for sharing language models.",november,True,32.53711266837113,3.513371395710873

Unfortunately, obtaining a perfect initialization for soft prompt requires understanding of inner language models working and elaborate design, which is no easy task and has to restart from scratch for each new task. To remedy this, we propose a generalized soft prompting method called MetaPrompting, which adopts the well-recognized model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to automatically find better prompt initialization that facilitates fast adaptation to new prompting tasks. Experiments show MetaPrompting brings significant improvements on three different datasets (over 6.5 points improvements for 1-shot setting), and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Our proposed encoder encodes both the BoW data and the sequence of words of a document, which can be complementary to each other for learning a better topic distribution for the document.

Our crowdsourced evaluations are conducted on the summaries of CNN-Daily Mail and XSum datasets generated by four state-of-the-art models. Ranking-based Best-Worst Scaling offers a more reliable measure of summary quality across datasets, and the reliability of Likert ratings highly depends on the target dataset and the evaluation design.

This leads to a lack of generalization in practice and redundant computation. In particular, the state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) require great time and computation resources. By borrowing an idea from software engineering, in order to address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm, SHIELD, which modifies and re-trains only the last layer of a textual NN, and thus it ""patches"" and ""transforms"" the NN into a stochastic weighted ensemble of multi-expert prediction heads. Considering that most of current black-box attacks rely on iterative search mechanisms to optimize their adversarial perturbations, SHIELD confuses the attackers by automatically utilizing different weighted ensembles of predictors depending on the input. In other words, SHIELD breaks a fundamental assumption of the attack, which is a victim NN model remains constant during an attack. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN, BERT, and RoBERTa-based textual NNs, once patched by SHIELD, exhibit a relative enhancement of 15%--70% in accuracy on average against 14 different black-box attacks, outperforming 6 defensive baselines across 3 public datasets.

The first task learns to select the correct sentiment words within the input, given the overall sentiment polarity as prior knowledge. On the contrary, the second task predicts the overall sentiment polarity given the sentiment polarity of the word as prior knowledge. In addition, two kinds of label combination methods are investigated to unify multiple types of labels in each task.

We combine a human evaluation of individual word substitutions and a probabilistic analysis to show that between 96% and 99% of the analyzed attacks do not preserve semantics, indicating that their success is mainly based on feeding poor data to the model. To further confirm that, we introduce an efficient data augmentation procedure and show that many successful attacks can be prevented by including data similar to adversarial examples during training. Compared to traditional adversarial training, our data augmentation procedure requires 30x less computation time per epoch, while achieving better performance on two out of three datasets. We introduce an additional post-processing step that reduces the success rates of state-of-the-art attacks below 4%, 5%, and 8% on the three considered datasets. Finally, by looking at constraints for word substitutions that better preserve the semantics, we conclude that BERT is considerably more robust than previous research suggests.

We do so by collecting annotations of arguments in the same documents following four different guidelines and from four different demographic annotator backgrounds. We show that annotations exhibit widely different levels of group disparity depending on which guidelines annotators follow. The differences are not explained by task complexity, but rather by characteristics of these groups, as previously identified by sociological studies.",november,True,12.797105215014984,-13.30899959288208
ULHJwUO0AUx,A Simple Information-Based Approach to Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task which aims to extract the aspects from sentences and identify their corresponding sentiments. Aspect term extraction (ATE) is the crucial step for ABSA. Due to the expensive annotation for aspect terms, we often lack labeled target domain data for fine-tuning. To address this problem, many approaches have been proposed recently to transfer common knowledge in an unsupervised way, but such methods have too many modules and require expensive multi-stage preprocessing. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective technique based on mutual information maximization, which can serve as an additional component to enhance any kind of model for cross-domain ABSA and ATE. Furthermore, we provide some analysis of this approach. Experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for cross-domain ABSA by 4.32\% Micro-F1 on average over 10 different domain pairs. Apart from that, our method can be extended to other sequence labeling tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER). Codes will be released. ",november,True,-27.850714759738104,24.83578479529813

To this end, we present a new practical task where only a few utterances of each fictional character are available to generate responses mimicking them. Furthermore, we propose a new method named Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) that generates responses by leveraging the power of large-scale language models with prompts containing the target character's utterances. To better reflect the style of the character, PDP builds the prompts in the form of dialog that includes the character's utterances as dialog history. Since only utterances of the characters are available in the proposed task, PDP matches each utterance with an appropriate pseudo-context from a predefined set of context candidates using a retrieval model. Through human and automatic evaluation, we show that PDP generates responses that better reflect the style of fictional characters than baseline methods.",november,True,-16.219969993836063,7.846699020620636

In contrast to prior work which learns language-specific components post-hoc, we pre-train the modules of our Cross-lingual Modular (X-Mod) models  from the start. Our experiments on natural language inference, named entity recognition and question answering show that our approach not only mitigates the negative interference between languages, but also enables positive transfer, resulting in improved monolingual and cross-lingual performance.

We present ReCLIP, a simple but strong zero-shot baseline that repurposes CLIP, a state-of-the-art large-scale model, for ReC. Motivated by  the close connection between ReC and CLIP’s contrastive pre-training objective, the first component of ReCLIP is a region-scoring method that isolates object proposals via cropping and blurring, and passes them to CLIP. However, through controlled experiments on a synthetic dataset, we find that CLIP is largely incapable of performing spatial reasoning off-the-shelf. Thus, the second component of ReCLIP is a spatial relation resolver that handles several types of spatial relations. We reduce the gap between zero-shot baselines from prior work and supervised models by as much as 30% on RefCOCOg, and on RefGTA (video game imagery), we outperform supervised ReC models trained on real images by an absolute 12%.",november,True,13.426658884149711,0.33572867914447935

Previous studies mainly focus on leveraging commonsense knowledge into generative models, which can improve the informativeness of generated texts.

In addition, we devise an inductive encoding module to reduce the sparsity of introduced event chains and learn the useful event evolution patterns. Specifically, we first extract event chains for the input text and then connect them as a graph. The inductive graph encoding module is then used to learn the inductive and generalized event embeddings. The event reasoning flow module follows and produces the event sketch, i.e., the reasonable events conditioned by the input text. Finally, we generate the text based on the input context and the event sketch.

Recent methods achieve considerable performance, but due to the insufficient consideration of triple global information, there is an obvious performance gap between triple (E1, R, E2) and E1/R/E2, that is, some extracted entities or relations fail to form a valid relational triple. To break this bottleneck,  we propose a relation-attentive 3D matrix  framework (RA3D)  composed of an encoder module, a fusion module, and a 3D matrix module. Instead of using a 2D table to align the subject and object, we integrate clearly encoded relation information to convert the 2D table into a 3D matrix, so that the entries of the 3D matrix can capture the interaction in subjects, objects, and relations completely. To extract relation and entity information required for the 3D matrix reasonably,  we design a transformer-decoder-based fusion module that updates the representation of relations and entities iteratively. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1 score up to 93.5\% and 94.3\% on two public datasets and delivers consistent performance gain on complex scenarios of overlapping triples.

The analysis of their output shows that these models frequently compute coherence on the basis of connections between (sub-)words which, from a linguistic perspective, should not play a role. Still, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance in several end applications. In contrast to these models, we compute coherence on the basis of entities by constraining the input to noun phrases and proper names. This provides us with an explicit representation of the most important items in sentences leading to the notion of focus. This brings our model linguistically in line with pre-neural models of computing coherence. It also gives us better insight into the behaviour of the model thus leading to better explainability. Our approach is also in accord with a recent study (O’Connor and Andreas, 2021), which shows that most usable information is captured by nouns and verbs in transformer-based language models. We evaluate our model on three downstream tasks showing that it is not only linguistically more sound than previous models but also that it outperforms them in end applications.",november,True,11.508182715437181,-3.4696827079399446

Recent studies envision the diverse potential of introducing unprecedented Transformer operators (OPs, such as Convolution) to its structure, yet the existing methods of doing so are all time-consuming. Traditionally, Single-Path One-Shot (SPOS) models enable efficient search over a vast set of OPs. However, existing SPOS methods on Transformer focus only on dimensional configurations of the vanilla Transformer OP (e.g., Multi-head Attention), and did not consider introducing other OPs. This paper explores the possibility of including OPs in the Transformer-based SPOS architecture search to discover better Transformer structures with the high efficiency facilitated in the SPOS category. To achieve that, we propose Dynamic Space Shrinking  (DSS), a novel method that resolves problems brought from newly added OPs by dynamically keeping the current sample space containing subnets with good configurations and performance.  We implemented DSS in ShrinkNAS, the first SPOS one-shot inter-OP model for Transformer.

Vtl4GfQJ9K,Modeling speech recognition and synthesis simultaneously: Encoding and decoding lexical and sublexical semantic information into speech with no access to speech data,"Human speakers encode information into raw speech which is then decoded by the listeners. This complex relationship between encoding (production) and decoding (perception) is often modeled separately. Here, we test how decoding of lexical and sublexical semantic information can emerge automatically from raw speech in unsupervised generative deep convolutional networks that combine both the production and perception principle. We introduce, to our knowledge, the most challenging objective in unsupervised lexical learning: an unsupervised network that must learn to assign unique representations for lexical items with no direct access to training data. We train several models (ciwGAN and fiwGAN by Beguš 2021) and test how the networks classify raw acoustic lexical items in the unobserved test data. Strong evidence in favor of lexical learning emerges. The architecture that combines the production and perception principles is thus able to learn to decode unique information from raw acoustic data in an unsupervised manner without ever accessing real training data. We propose a technique to explore lexical and sublexical learned representations in the classifier network. The results bear implications for both unsupervised speech synthesis and recognition as well as for unsupervised semantic modeling as language models increasingly bypass text and operate from raw acoustics.

uvLxnBf2zx,GauSE: Gaussian Enhanced Self-Attention for Event Extraction,"Event Extraction (EE) has benefited from pre-trained language models (PLMs), in which the self-attention mechanism could pay attention to the global relationship between triggers/arguments and context words to enhance performance. However, existing PLM-based methods are not good enough at capturing local trigger/argument-specific knowledge. To this end, we propose a Gaussian enhanced Self-attention Event extraction framework (GauSE), which models the syntactic-related local information of trigger/argument as a Gaussian bias for the first time, to pay more attention to the syntactic scope of the local region. Furthermore, existing methods rarely consider multiple occurrences of the same triggers/arguments in EE. We explore the global interaction strategies among multiple localness of the same triggers/arguments to fuse the corresponding distributions and capture more latent information scopes. Compared to traditional GCN-based models, our methods could introduce syntactic relationships without over-smoothing problem in deep GCN layers. Experiments on EE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed approach.",november,True,-16.028337452385976,33.97987752901413

There is a lot of noise in the knowledge pool, and appropriate knowledge selection plays an important role. Existing methods can only select one piece of knowledge to participate in the generation of the response, which inevitably loses some useful clues contained in the discarded candidates.

MSEL takes the dialog context and knowledge pool as inputs and predicts a subset of knowledge pool in sequence-to-sequence manner.

To detect harassment, we adopted sentiment analysis with a supervised learning approach that combines Machine Learning (ML) text classifiers with a lexicon approach that provides a feedback loop to retrain the ML model with unknown terms. Because good data is essential to obtain the best output of any system, we focused on validating our labeled data. Our results on static and real-time data have an accuracy of, respectively, 90% and 94%. Our labeled data validation allows us to correct labels; we also realized the need to increase the number of sets in our lexicons.

Short texts can be enriched with more complex semantic relationships that can better capture affective information, with a potential undesired side effect of noise introduced into the data. In this work, we propose a new strategy for customized dataset-oriented sentiment analysis -- CluSent -- that exploits a powerful, recently proposed concept for representing semantically related words -- CluWords. CluSent tackles the issues mentioned above of information shortage and noise by: (i) exploiting the semantic neighborhood of a given pre-trained word embedding to enrich document representation, and (ii) introducing dataset-oriented filtering and weighting mechanisms to cope with noise, which take advantage of the polarity and intensity information from lexicons. In our experimental evaluation, considering 19 datasets,  5 state-of-the-art baselines (including modern transformer architectures) and two metrics, CluSent was the best method in 30 out of 38 possibilities, with significant gains over the strongest baselines (over 14%).",november,True,-25.103312537438207,21.180559263546893

W2wE4vUe1Te,Are Shortest Rationales the Best Explanations For Human Understanding?,"Existing self-explaining models typically favor extracting the shortest rationales possible (“shortest yet coherent subset of input to predict the same label”), with the assumption that short rationales are more intuitive to humans, even though short rationales lead to lower accuracy.   However, there is a lack of human studies on validating the effect of rationale length on human understanding. Is the shortest rationale indeed the most understandable for humans? To answer this question, we design a self-explaining model that can take control on rationale length.  Our model incorporates contextual information and supports flexibly extracting rationales at any target length. Through quantitative evaluation on model performance, we further verify that our method  LIMITEDINK outperforms existing self-explaining baselines on both end-task prediction and human-annotated rationale agreement.  We use it to generate rationales at 5 length levels, and conduct user studies to understand how much rationale would be sufficient for humans to confidently make predictions. We show that while most prior work extracts 10%-30% of the text to be the rationale, human accuracy tends to stabilize after seeing 40% of the full text.

NaVgf-NPQev,Description-Driven Task-Oriented Dialog Modeling,"Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are required to identify key information from conversations for the completion of given tasks. Such information is conventionally specified in terms of intents and slots contained in task-specific ontology or schemata. Since these schemata are designed by system developers, the naming convention for slots and intents is not uniform across tasks, and may not convey their semantics effectively. This can lead to models memorizing arbitrary patterns in data, resulting in suboptimal performance and generalization. In this paper, we propose that schemata should be modified by replacing names or notations entirely with natural language descriptions. We show that a language description-driven system exhibits better understanding of task specifications, higher performance on state tracking, improved data efficiency, and effective zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks. Following this paradigm, we present a simple yet effective Description-Driven Dialog State Tracking (D3ST) model, which relies purely on schema descriptions and an ""index-picking'' mechanism. We demonstrate the superiority in quality, data efficiency and robustness of our approach as measured on the MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al.,2018), SGD (Rastogi et al., 2020), and the recent SGD-X (Lee et al., 2021) benchmarks.",november,True,-8.367599257220537,9.594458116836481
MJfmRtVReXs,Training a Turn-level User Engagingness Predictor for Dialogues with Weak Supervision,"The standard approach to evaluating dialogue engagingness is by measuring conversation turns per session (CTPS), which implies that the dialogue length is the main predictor of the user engagement with a dialogue system. The main limitation of CTPS is that it can be measured only at the session level, i.e., once the dialogue is already over. However, it is crucial for a dialogue system to continuously monitor user engagement throughout the dialogue session as well. Existing approaches to measuring turn-level engagingness require human annotations for training and lack interpretability of their scores. We pioneer an alternative approach, Remaining Depth as Engagingness Predictor (RDEP), which uses the remaining depth (RD) for each turn as the heuristic weak label for engagingness. RDEP does not require human annotations and also relates closely to CTPS, thus serving as a good learning proxy for this metric. In our experiments, we show that RDEP achieves the new state-of-the-art results on the fine-grained evaluation of dialog (FED) dataset (0.38 Spearman) and the Daily-Dialog dataset (0.62 Spearman).

lPx3fzsTTrK,Learning to Teach with Student Feedback,"Knowledge distillation (KD) has gained much attention due to its effectiveness in compressing large-scale pre-trained models. In typical KD methods, the small student model is trained to match the soft targets generated by the big teacher model. However, the interaction between student and teacher is one-way. The teacher is usually fixed once trained, resulting in static soft targets to be distilled. This one-way interaction leads to the teacher's inability to perceive the characteristics of the student and its training progress. To address this issue, we propose Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which also allows the teacher to learn to teach from the feedback of the student. In particular, IKD trains the teacher model to generate specific soft target at each training step for a certain student. Joint optimization for both teacher and student is achieved by two iterative steps: a course step to optimize student with the soft target of teacher, and an exam step to optimize teacher with the feedback of student. IKD is a general framework that is orthogonal to most existing knowledge distillation methods. Experimental results show that IKD outperforms traditional KD methods on various NLP tasks.",november,True,1.772224484955038,-43.703922984874005

In this paper, we investigate the most commonly used topic modelling evaluation scores in terms of their alignment with human judgment in the specific area of dialog speech. We show that there is still space for improvement in the objective evaluation of topic modelling, and propose a new group of metrics, called Pairwise Proximity metrics, that are shown to align better with human judgment, when compared to coherence and silhouette scores.

However, a potential pitfall for this approach is that we cannot decide whether the generated examples are adversarial to the target NMT model or the auxiliary backward one, as the reconstruction error through the RTT can be related to either. To remedy this problem, we propose a new definition for NMT adversarial examples based on the Doubly Round-Trip Translation (DRTT). Specifically, apart from the source-target-source RTT, we also consider the target-source-target one, which is utilized to pick out the authentic adversarial examples for the target NMT model. Additionally, to enhance the robustness of the NMT model, we introduce the masked language models to construct bilingual adversarial pairs based on DRTT, which are used to train the NMT model directly.

Thus it makes a lot of sense to make use of unlabelled uni-modal data. On the other side, although the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised learning is well established in both audio and visual modalities, how to integrate those pre-trained models into a multimodal scenario remains underexplored. In this work, we successfully leverage uni-modal self-supervised learning to promote the multimodal AVSR. In particular, we first train audio and visual encoders on a large-scale uni-modal dataset, then we integrate components of both encoders into a larger multimodal framework which learns to recognize paired audio-visual data into characters through a combination of CTC and seq2seq decoding. We show that both components inherited from uni-modal self-supervised learning cooperate well, resulting in that the multimodal framework yields competitive results through fine-tuning. Our model is experimentally validated on both word-level and sentence-level AVSR tasks.

In this paper, we propose an Evidence Decomposition Graph Network (EDGN), which decomposes each evidence sentence, especially the complex ones, into several simple sentences, highlighting the required key information without losing sentence structure and meaning. EDGN also absorbs a simple but effective evidence shuffling method to mitigate exposure bias.

Previous studies indicate that the shortcut deriving from the biased data distribution in training set makes spurious correlations between features and labels. In this paper, we focus on analyzing and mitigating the biased data distribution in question matching by exploring the model behavior and performance. In particular, we define bias-word as the shortcut, and explore the following questions: (1) Will the bias affect the model? (2) How does the bias affect the model's decision?

MVcv5KxTqu_,Answering Open-Domain Multi-Answer Questions via a Recall-then-Verify Framework,"Open-domain questions are likely to be open-ended and ambiguous, leading to multiple valid answers. Existing approaches typically adopt the rerank-then-read framework, where a reader reads top-ranking evidence to predict answers. According to our empirical analysis, this framework faces three problems: first, to leverage a large reader under a memory constraint, the reranker should select only a few relevant passages to cover diverse answers, while balancing relevance and diversity is non-trivial; second, the small reading budget prevents the reader from accessing valuable retrieved evidence filtered out by the reranker; third, when using a generative reader to predict answers all at once based on all selected evidence, whether a valid answer will be predicted also pathologically depends on evidence of some other valid answer(s). To address these issues, we propose to answer open-domain multi-answer questions with a recall-then-verify framework, which separates the reasoning process of each answer so that we can make better use of retrieved evidence while also leveraging large models under the same memory constraint. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-answer datasets, and predicts significantly more gold answers than a rerank-then-read system that uses an oracle reranker.",november,True,4.8387146245354975,20.098138843131405
UDFO2MjWRUR,Towards a Progression-Aware Autonomous Dialogue Agent,"Recent advances in large-scale language modeling and generation have enabled the creation of dialogue agents that exhibit human-like responses in a wide range of conversational scenarios spanning a diverse set of tasks, from general chit-chat to focused goal-oriented discourse. While these agents excel at generating high-quality responses that are relevant to prior context, they suffer from a lack of awareness of the overall direction in which the conversation is headed, and the likelihood of task success inherent therein. Thus, we propose a framework in which dialogue agents can evaluate the progression of a conversation toward or away from desired outcomes, and use this signal to inform planning for subsequent responses. Our framework is composed of three key elements: (1) the notion of a ""global"" dialogue state (GDS) space, (2) a task-specific progression function (PF) computed in terms of a conversation's trajectory through this space, and (3) a planning mechanism by which a dialogue agent may use progression signals to select its next response.",november,True,-14.79445798118263,14.52609076231591

EsQHxNYt0u,How to Translate Your Samples and Choose Your Shots? Analyzing Translate-train & Few-shot Cross-lingual Transfer,"Translate-train or few-shot cross-lingual transfer can be used to improve the zero-shot performance of multilingual pretrained language models. Few-shot utilizes high-quality low-quantity samples (often manually translated from the English corpus to the target language). Translate-train employs a machine translation of the English corpus, resulting in samples with lower quality that could be scaled to high quantity. Given the lower cost and higher availability of machine translation compared to manual professional translation, it is important to systematically compare few-shot and translate-train, understand when few-shot is beneficial, and whether choosing the shots to translate increases the few-shot gain. This work aims to fill this gap: we compare and quantify the performance gain of few-shot vs. translate-train using a varying number of samples for three tasks/datasets (XNLI, PAWS-X, XQuAD) spanning 17 languages. We show that scaling up the training data using machine translation gives a larger gain compared to using the small-scale (higher-quality) few-shot data. When few-shot is beneficial, we show that there are random sets of samples that perform better across languages and that the performance on English and on the machine-translation of the samples can both be used to choose the shots to manually translate for an increased few-shot gain.",november,True,14.898216231141646,-28.86673185551102

This work proposes a novel \emph{self-distillation} based pruning strategy, whereby the representational similarity between the pruned and unpruned versions of the same network is maximized. Unlike previous approaches that treat distillation and pruning separately, we use distillation to inform the pruning criteria, without requiring a separate student network as in knowledge distillation. We show that the proposed {\em cross-correlation objective for self-distilled pruning} implicitly encourages sparse solutions, naturally complementing magnitude-based pruning criteria. Experiments on the GLUE and XGLUE benchmarks show that self-distilled pruning increases mono- and cross-lingual language model performance. Self-distilled pruned models also outperform smaller Transformers with an equal number of parameters and are competitive against (6 times) larger distilled networks. We also observe that self-distillation (1) maximizes class separability, (2) increases the signal-to-noise ratio, and (3) converges faster after pruning steps, providing further insights into why self-distilled pruning improves generalization.

Existing work formalizes the task as matching between the utterances and a candidate and uses the cross-entropy loss in learning of the model. This paper applies contrastive learning to the problem by using the supervised contrastive loss.  In this way, the learned representations of positive examples and representations of negative examples can be more distantly separated in the embedding space, and the performance of matching can be enhanced. We further develop a new method for supervised contrastive learning, referred to as two-level supervised contrastive learning, and employ the method in response selection in multi-turn dialogue. Our method exploits two techniques:  sentence token shuffling (STS) and sentence re-ordering (SR) for supervised contrastive learning.

Our fellow researchers have attempted to achieve such a purpose through various machine learning-based approaches. One key challenge keeping these approaches from being practical lies in the lacking of retaining the semantic structure of source code, which has unfortunately been overlooked by the state-of-the-art. Existing approaches resort to representing the syntax structure of code by modeling the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). However, the hierarchical structures of ASTs have not been well explored. In this paper, we propose CODESCRIBE to model the hierarchical syntax structure of code by introducing a novel triplet position for code summarization. Specifically, CODESCRIBE leverages the graph neural network and Transformer to preserve the structural and sequential information of code, respectively. In addition, we propose a pointer-generator network that pays attention to both the structure and sequential tokens of code for a better summary generation.

Weak supervision methods, such as Snorkel, make use of the vastness of unlabeled data, but largely omit the available ground truth labels. We combine data augmentation and weak supervision techniques into a holistic method, consisting of 4 training phases and 2 inference phases, to efficiently train an end-to-end model when only a small amount of annotated data is available. We outperform the benchmark (Kumar et al.,2020) for the SST-2 task by 1.5, QQP task by 4.4, and QNLI task by 3.0 absolute accuracy points, and show that data augmentation is also effective for natural language understanding tasks, such as QQP and QNLI.",november,True,19.205116951160516,5.9993337290001145

The lack of grammatical structure of spoken utterances, combined with word errors introduced by the ASR, makes downstream NLP tasks challenging. In this paper, we examine the impact of ASR errors on the ability of NER models to recover entity mentions from transcripts of spontaneous human conversations in English. We experimentally compare several commercial ASR systems paired with state-of-the-art NER models. We use both publicly available benchmark datasets (Switchboard Named Entity Corpus, SWNE), and the proprietary, real-life dataset of gold (human-transcribed) phone conversation transcripts.

BXfSKkEbCtW,All Birds with One Stone: Multi-task Learning for Inference with One Forward Pass,"Task-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained language models like Transformers has shown their effectiveness in various NLP tasks. To achieve better storage efficiency and model performance, Multi-task Learning (MTL) has been studied to share model parameters and utilize knowledge transfer between tasks. However, in real applications where enormous numbers of tasks (e.g., large sets of labels to be classified) need to be conducted on a large corpus, the inference efficiency is still hindered by the number of tasks. For a document with N sets of labels to be predicted, recent MTL methods with adaptive modules or prompts need to encode the input data N times to extract the hidden representation needed for the tasks. Notice that the hidden representation is not sharable between tasks, as task-specific features are extracted at very bottom layers in the Transformer.  In this paper, we seek to maintain the computational efficiency of only requiring one forward pass for a document to get a generalized feature for all N tasks, without sacrificing overall model performance. We design a prompt-sharing module to let the model take all tasks into considerations and output N heads simultaneously.  We also design a dynamic task scheduling module to sample tasks according to their training progress.  In our evaluation, we show that our method is able to outperform previous MTL state-of-the-arts and single task fine-tuning by 0.4-1.5% on GLUE benchmark dataset.

However, we argue that, the semantic information can form a \emph{causal} relationship with the target labels of the NLU task, while the biases information is only \emph{correlative} to the target labels. Such difference between the semantic information and dataset biases still remains not fully addressed, which limits the effectiveness of debiasing.

This is enabled by a backbone network with linear bottleneck matrices around each Transformer layer which are sliced to generate differently shaped sub-networks. Despite its simple design space and efficient implementation, SuperShaper radically simplifies NAS for language models and discovers networks that effectively trade-off accuracy and model size: Discovered networks are more accurate than a range of hand-crafted and automatically searched networks on GLUE benchmarks. Further, we find two critical advantages of shape as a design variable for Neural Architecture Search (NAS): (a) networks found with these heuristics derived for good shapes, match and even improve on carefully searched networks across a range of parameter counts, and (b) the latency of networks across multiple CPUs and GPUs are insensitive to the shape and thus enable device-agnostic search.",november,True,2.808221778704071,-14.018444915419938

Meanwhile, the focus of advanced studies  has changed primarily to estimating the relationship between the discovered topical structure and theoretically relevant metadata. Methods used to estimate such relationships must take into account that the topical structure is not directly observed, but instead being estimated itself in an unsupervised fashion. In the Structural Topic Model (STM;Roberts et al., 2016), for instance, multiple repeated linear regressions of sampled topic proportions on metadata covariates are performed. This is done by using a Monte Carlo sampling technique known as the \textit{method of composition}. In this paper, we propose two modifications of this approach: First, we implement a substantial correction to the model by replacing linear regression with the more appropriate Beta regression. Second, we provide a fundamental enhancement of the entire estimation framework by substituting the current blending of frequentist and Bayesian methods with a fully Bayesian approach instead. This allows for a more appropriate quantification of uncertainty.

mwqdoc4kCp-,Compositional Data Augmentation for Abstractive Conversation Summarization,"Recent abstractive conversation summarization systems generally rely on large-scale annotated summaries. However, collecting conversations and annotating their corresponding summaries can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To alleviate the data scarcity issue, in this work, we present a simple yet effective compositional data augmentation method, Compo, for generating diverse and high-quality pairs of conversations and summaries. Specifically, we generate novel conversation and summary pairs through first extracting conversation snippets and summary sentences based on conversation stages and then randomly composing them constrained by the temporal relation and semantic similarities. To deal with the noises in the augmented data, we further utilize knowledge distillation to learn concise representation from a teacher model trained on high-quality data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Compo significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and exhibits a reasonable level of interpretability.",november,True,10.807185749174847,31.44057108141562

Towards building a human-like assistant that can converse naturally and seamlessly with users, the system needs to be able to conduct both types of conversations effectively. In this work, we investigate how task-oriented dialogue and knowledge-grounded chit-chat can be effectively integrated into a single model.

It often requires thorough understanding of temporal common sense and multimodal information, since these procedures are often conveyed by a combination of texts and images. While humans are capable of reasoning about and sequencing unordered procedural instructions, the extent to which the current machine learning methods possess such a capability is still an open question. In this work, we benchmark models' capability of reasoning over and sequencing unordered multimodal instructions by curating datasets from online instructional manuals and collecting comprehensive human annotations. We find current state-of-the-art models not only perform significantly worse than humans but also seem incapable of efficiently utilizing  multimodal information.

Moreover, we combine four levels of relation abstractions to ensure the integrity of relation information and hence to enrich the relation representation.

Approaches to adversarial attacks in natural language tasks have boomed in the last five years using character-level, word-level, phrase-level, or sentence-level textual perturbations. While there is some work in NLP on defending against such attacks through proactive methods, like adversarial training, there is to our knowledge no effective reactive approaches to defence via detection of textual adversarial examples such as is found in the image processing literature. In this paper, we apply distance-based ensemble learning and semantic representations from different representation learning models based on our understanding of the reason for adversarial examples to fill this gap.

XKEFSwYUewV,Inverse is Better! Fast and Accurate Prompt for Slot Tagging,"Prompting methods recently achieve impressive success in few-shot learning. These methods embed input samples with prompt sentence pieces and decode label-related tokens to map samples to the label. However, such a paradigm is very inefficient for the task of slot tagging. Because the slot tagging samples are multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have to enumerate all n-grams token span to find all the possible slots, which greatly slows down the prediction. To tackle this, we introduce an inverse paradigm for prompting. Different from the classic prompts map tokens to labels, we reversely predict slot values given slot types. Such inverse prompting only requires a one-turn prediction for each slot type and greatly speeds up the prediction. Besides, we propose a novel Iterative Prediction Strategy, from which the model learns to refine predictions by considering the relations between different slot types. We find, somewhat surprisingly, the proposed method not only predicts faster, but also significantly improves the effect (improve over 6.1 F1-scores on 10-shot setting) and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.",november,True,-2.4189782023188378,-27.675194963123264

While most prior literature assumes access to large style-labelled corpora, recent work (Riley et al. 2021) has attempted ""few-shot"" style transfer using only 3-10 sentences at inference for extracting the target style. In this work we study a relevant low-resource setting: style transfer for languages where no style-labelled corpora are available. We find that existing few-shot methods perform this task poorly, with a strong tendency to copy inputs verbatim. We push the state-of-the-art for few-shot style transfer with a new method modeling the stylistic difference between paraphrases. When compared to prior work using automatic and human evaluations, our model achieves 2-3x better performance and output diversity in formality transfer and code-mixing addition across seven languages. Moreover, our method is better able to control the amount of style transfer using an input scalar knob. We report promising qualitative results for several attribute transfer directions, including sentiment transfer, text simplification, gender neutralization and text anonymization, all without retraining the model. Finally we found model evaluation to be difficult due to the lack of evaluation datasets and metrics for many languages.

A number of factors are known to influence Hindi word order preferences in isolation, including information structure and syntactic complexity. However, the relative impact of these factors on Hindi constituent ordering is not well understood. Inspired by prior work on syntactic priming, we investigate how the words and syntactic structures in a sentence influence the word order of the following sentences. Specifically, we extract sentences from the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus (HUTB), we permute the preverbal constituents of those sentences, and we build a classifier to predict which sentences actually occurred in the corpus against our generated distractors. The classifier uses a number of discourse-based features and cognitive features to make its predictions, including dependency length, surprisal, and information status.

Still, it is a mystery how Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers leveraging the parameters with sparse activation bring quality gains. In this work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We find that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality, and auxiliary balancing loss can be removed without significant performance degrade. We further discover that larger number of sparsely activated experts $k$ may not necessarily benefit the performance on the time basis, and we observe diminishing marginal utility that the performance gap gradually narrows with the increase in $k$. We take a step forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits experts into different prototypes and applies top-$k$ routing for each prototype in parallel. Our experiments demonstrate that the prototyping strategy improves the model quality, in comparison with further increasing to a larger $k$ with comparable computation cost to prototyping. Furthermore, we conduct an exploration on training extremely large-scale models, and we figure out that the strategy shows greater effectiveness in training larger models. Notably, we push the model scale to over $1$ trillion parameters on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs.

However, these existing solutions are heavily affected by superficial features like the length of sentences or syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware contrastive learning framework for sentence embeddings, termed Pseudo-Token BERT (PT-BERT), which is able to explore the pseudo-token space (i.e., latent semantic space) representation of a sentence while eliminating the impact of superficial features such as sentence length and syntax. Specifically, we introduce an additional pseudo token embedding layer independent of the BERT encoder to map each sentence into a sequence of pseudo tokens in a fixed length. Leveraging these pseudo sequences, we are able to construct same-length positive and negative pairs based on the attention mechanism to perform contrastive learning. In addition, we utilize both the gradient-updating and momentum-updating encoders to encode instances while dynamically maintaining an additional queue to store the representation of sentence embeddings, enhancing the encoder's learning performance for negative examples. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on six standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks.

We introduce CaM-Gen: Causally-aware Generative Networks guided by user-defined target metrics incorporating the causal relationships between the metric and content features. We leverage causal inference techniques to identify causally significant aspects of a text that lead to the target metric and then explicitly guide generative models towards these by a feedback mechanism. We propose this mechanism for variational autoencoder and Transformer-based generative models. The proposed models beat baselines in terms of the target metric control while maintaining fluency and language quality of the generated text.

Often the objective is to capture distributional similarity via vector dot product, however this is just one relation between word meanings we may wish to capture.  It is natural to consider words as (soft) equivalence classes based on similarity, it is natural to expect the ability to perform set-theoretic operations (intersection, union, difference) on these representations. This is particularly relevant for words which are homographs- for example, “tongue”∩“body” should be similar to “mouth”, while “tongue”∩“language” should  be  similar  to  “dialect”. Box embeddings are a novel region-based representation which provide the capability to perform these set-theoretic operations.

f7ia5zVf06N,On the interpretability and significance of bias metrics in texts: a PMI-based approach,"In recent years, the use of word embeddings has become popular to measure the presence of biases in texts. Despite the fact that these measures have been proven to be effective in detecting a wide variety of biases, metrics based on word embeddings lack transparency, explainability and interpretability. In this study, we propose a PMI-based metric to quantify biases in texts. We prove that this metric can be approximated by an odds ratio, which allows estimating the confidence interval and statistical significance of textual bias. This PMI-based measure can be expressed as a function of conditional probabilities, providing a simple interpretation in terms of word co-occurrences. Our approach produces a performance comparable to GloVe-based and skip-gram-based metrics in experiments of gender-occupation and gender-name associations. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using methods based on first-order vs second-order co-occurrences, from the point of view of the interpretability of the metric and the sparseness of the data.",november,True,12.138873074071316,-11.791500633310989
d0ECgzUIS3T,Towards Community-Driven NLP: Measuring Geographic Performance Disparities of Offensive Language Classifiers,"Text classifiers are applied at scale in the form of one-size-fits-all solutions. Nevertheless, many studies show that many classifiers are biased regarding different languages and dialects. Both language style and content change depending on the location that it is posted. For example, states that border Mexico may be more likely to discuss issues regarding immigration from Latin America. However, several questions remain, such as ``Do changes in the style and content of text across geographic regions impact model performance?''. We introduce a novel dataset called GeoOLID with more than 13 thousand examples across 15 geographically and demographically diverse cites to address this question. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis of geographical content and stylistic differences and their interaction in causing performance disparities of Offensive Language Detection models. Overall, we find that current models do not generalize across. Likewise, we show that understanding broad dialects (e.g., African American English) is not the only predictive factor of model performance when applied to cities with large minority populations. Hence, community-specific evaluation is vital for real-world applications. Warning: This paper contains offensive language.",november,True,22.118750657645695,2.6462679617095803
FEg_0BrW4Ks,CQARE: Contrastive Question-Answering for Few-shot Relation Extraction with Prompt Tuning,"Prompt tuning with pre-trained language models (PLM) has exhibited outstanding performance by closing the gap between pre-training tasks and various downstream applications, without the need for uninitialized parameters to be introduced. However, prompt tuning requires vast amounts of prompt engineering and predefined label word mapping, which obstructs its implements in practice. Besides, the ample label space makes prompt tuning more arduous and challenging when it comes to relation extraction (RE). To tackle these issues, we propose a Contrastive Question-Answering method with prompt tuning for few-shot RE (CQARE). CQARE carries out a RE task-specific pre-training with four entity-relation-aware pre-training objects, including a prompt pre-training to automatically generate continuous prompts. The proposed pre-training can provide more robust initialization with prompt tuning while maintaining semantic consistency with the proposed PLM. Furthermore, CQARE can effectively avoid label words mapping by reformulating RE as contrastive question answering. The results indicate CQARE raising averaged accuracy of 5.11\% on a cross-domain few-shot dataset, demonstrating that robust initialization is crucial for prompt tuning and effective contrastive question answering.",november,True,-5.249867709907665,-24.874611069859686

iMNie7QL81W,UserIdentifier: Implicit User Representations for Simple and Effective Personalized Sentiment Analysis,"Conventionally trained classification models are trained to be as generalizable as possible, with user invariance considered desirable since the models are shared across multitudes of users.  As such, these models are often unable to produce personalized responses for individual users, based on their data.  Contrary to widely-used personalization techniques based on few-shot and meta learning, we  propose UserIdentifier, a novel scheme for training a single shared model for all users. Our approach produces personalized responses by prepending a fixed, user-specific non-trainable string (called ``user identifier'') to each user's input text. Unlike prior work, this method doesn't need any additional model parameters, any extra rounds of personal few-shot learning or any change made to the vocabulary. We empirically study different types of user identifiers (numeric, alphanumeric and also randomly generated) and demonstrate that, surprisingly, randomly generated user identifiers outperform the prefix-tuning based state-of-the-art approach by up to 13%, on a suite of sentiment analysis datasets.

3cdnseDIyZP,A Generative Language Model for Few-shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing. In recent works, pre-trained language models are often used to achieve state-of-the-art results, especially when training data is scarce. It is common to fine-tune on the downstream task, usually by adding task-specific layers on top of the model. In this paper, we focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis, which involves extracting aspect term, category, and predicting their corresponding polarities. In particular, we are interested in few-shot settings. We propose to reformulate the extraction and prediction tasks into the sequence generation task, using a generative language model with unidirectional attention (GPT2 is used unless stated otherwise). This way, the model learns to accomplish the tasks via language generation without the need of training task-specific layers. Our evaluation results on the single-task polarity prediction show that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (based on BERT) on average performance by a large margins in few-shot and full-shot settings. More importantly, our generative approach significantly reduces the model variance caused by  low-resource data. We further demonstrate that the proposed generative language model can handle joint and multi-tasking settings, unlike previous work. We observe that the proposed sequence generation method achieves further improved performances on polarity prediction when the model is trained via joint and multi-tasking settings. Further evaluation on similar sentiment analysis datasets, SST-2, SST-5 and OOS intent detection validates the superiority and noise robustness of generative language model in few-shot settings.",november,True,-25.604218852802667,22.219280431262423

We apply this framework to annotate the RecipeRef corpus with both bridging and coreference relations. Through comparison to chemical patents, we show the complexity of anaphora resolution in recipes. We demonstrate empirically that transfer learning from the chemical domain improves resolution of anaphora in recipes, suggesting transferability of general procedural knowledge.

lfz6pM0shv,WeaNF: Weak Supervision with Normalizing Flows,"A popular approach to decrease the need for costly manual annotation of large data sets is weak supervision, which introduces problems of noisy labels, coverage and bias. Methods for overcoming these problems have either relied on discriminative models, trained with cost functions specific to weak supervision, and more recently, generative models, trying to  model the output of the automatic annotation process. In this work, we explore a novel direction of generative modeling for weak supervision: Instead of modeling the output of the annotation process (the labeling function matches), we generatively model the input-side data distributions (the feature space) covered by labeling functions. Specifically, we estimate a density for each weak labeling source, or labeling function, by using normalizing flows. An integral part of our method is the flow-based modeling of multiple simultaneously matching labeling functions, and therefore phenomena such as labeling function overlap and correlations are captured. We analyze the effectiveness and modeling capabilities on various commonly used weak supervision data sets, and show that weakly supervised normalizing flows compare favorably to standard weak supervision baselines.

IoJr7kQ33aM,Subword Information for Authorship Attribution: A Deep Learning Approach,"Authorship attribution is the process of unveiling the hidden identity of authors from a corpus of literary data. Many previous works on authorship attribution employed word-based models to capture an author's distinctive writing style. The vocabulary of the training corpus is heavily dependent on the pre-trained word vectors, which limits the performance of these models. Alternate methods using character-based models proposed to overcome the rare word problems arising from different linguistic features fail to capture the sequential relationship of words inherently present in the texts. The question we addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to tackle the ambiguity of hidden writing style (or words) as we introduce Gaussian noise while preserving the sequential context of the text to improve authorship-related tasks. In this work,  we propose two bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) with a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) over a two-dimensional pooling operation to capture sequential writing styles for distinguishing different authors. To determine the appropriate writing style representation, we used BLSTM to obtain the sequential relationship between characteristics using subword information and 2D CNN is adopted to understand the local syntactical position of the style from unlabelled input text. We extensively evaluate the model that leverages subword embedding and compare it against state-of-the-art methods for an extensive range of authors.

CRS is a complex problem that consists of two main tasks: (1) recommendation and (2) response generation. Previous work often tried to solve the problem in a modular manner, where recommenders and response generators are separate neural models. Such modular architectures often come with a complicated and unintuitive connection between the modules, leading to inefficient learning and other issues. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on BART for conversational recommendation, which tackles two tasks in a single model.

After injected into a backdoor, a deep neural model will behave normally on standard inputs but give adversary-specified predictions once the input contains specific backdoor triggers. Current textual backdoor attacks have poor attack performance in some tough situations. In this paper, we find two simple tricks that can make existing textual backdoor attacks much more harmful. The first trick is to add an extra training task to distinguish poisoned and clean data during the training of the victim model, and the second one is to use all the clean training data rather than remove the original clean data corresponding to the poisoned data. These two tricks are universally applicable to different attack models. We conduct experiments in three tough situations including clean data fine-tuning, low-poisoning-rate, and label-consistent attacks. Experimental results show that the two tricks can significantly improve attack performance. This paper exhibits the great potential harmfulness of backdoor attacks.

In particular, randomly-generated character n-grams lack semantic meaning but contain primitive information based on the distribution of characters they contain. By studying the embeddings of a large corpus of garble, extant language, and pseudowords using CharacterBERT, we identify an axis in the model's high-dimensional embedding space that separates these classes of n-grams. Furthermore, we show that this axis relates to structure within extant language, including word part of speech, morphology, and concreteness. Thus, in contrast to studies that are mainly limited to extant language, our work reveals that semantic meaning and primitive information are intrinsically linked.",november,True,-6.7967243004491475,-10.059609372756737

This means that, even when considered accurate and fluent, MT output can still sound less natural than high quality human translations or text originally written in the target language.

In this work we propose a method for training MT systems to achieve a more natural style, i.e. mirroring the style of text originally written in the target language. Our method tags parallel training data according to the naturalness of the target side by contrasting language models trained on natural and translated data. Tagging data allows us to put greater emphasis on target sentences originally written in the target language.

-FrhVMO65W,Improved Multi-label Classification under Temporal Concept Drift: Rethinking Group-Robust Algorithms in a Label-Wise Setting," In document classification for, e.g., legal and biomedical text, we often deal with hundreds of classes, including very infrequent ones, as well as temporal concept drift caused by the influence of real-world events, e.g., policy changes, conflicts, or pandemics. Both class imbalance and drift are often approached by resampling the training data to simulate (or compensate for) a known target distribution, but what if the target distribution is determined by unknown future events? Instead of resampling uniformly to hedge our bets, we focus on the underlying optimization algorithms used to train such document classifiers and evaluate several group-robust optimization algorithms, initially proposed to mitigate group-level disparities. Reframing group-robust algorithms as adaptation algorithms under concept drift, we find that Invariant Risk Minimization and Spectral Decoupling outperform sampling-based approaches to class imbalance and concept drift, and lead to much better performance on minority classes. The effect is more pronounced the larger the label set. ",november,True,14.405029241438253,-2.1239726902855214

0TReq1EztTt,Alleviating the Sparsity of Open Knowledge Graphs with Pretrained Contrastive Learning,"Due to the sparsity of formal knowledge and the roughness of non-ontological construction methods, relevant facts are often missing in Open Knowledge Graphs (OpenKGs). Although existing completion methods have achieved promising performance, they do not alleviate the sparsity problem of OpenKGs. Owing to fewer training chances caused by sparse links, many few-shot and zero-shot entities cannot fully learn high-dimensional features. In this paper, we propose a new OpenKG Contrastive Learning (OKGCL) model to alleviate the sparsity with contrastive entities and relations. OKGCL designs (a) negative entities to discriminate different entities with the same relation, (b) negative relations to discriminate different relations with the same entity-pair, and (c) \emph{self} positive samples to give zero-shot and few-shot entities chances to learn discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of OKGCL over state-of-the-art models.",november,True,-35.755231041586036,3.0696776932829635

In this paper, we focus on one-shot primitive generalization as introduced by the popular SCAN benchmark. We demonstrate that modifying the training distribution in simple and intuitive ways enables standard seq-to-seq models to achieve near-perfect generalization performance, thereby showing that their compositional generalization abilities were previously underestimated. We perform detailed empirical analysis of this phenomenon.

In this work, we provide an appealing alternative for NAT -- monolingual KD, which trains NAT student on external monolingual data with AT teacher trained on the original bilingual data. Monolingual KD is able to transfer both the knowledge of the original bilingual data (implicitly encoded in the trained AT teacher model) and that of the new monolingual data to the NAT student model. Extensive experiments on eight WMT benchmarks over two advanced NAT models show that monolingual KD consistently outperforms the standard KD by improving low-frequency word translation, without introducing any computational cost. Monolingual KD enjoys desirable expandability, which can be further enhanced (when given more computational budget) by combining with the standard KD, a reverse monolingual KD, or enlarging the scale of monolingual data. Extensive analyses demonstrate that these techniques can be used together profitably to further recall the useful information lost in the standard KD. Encouragingly, combining with standard KD, our approach achieves 30.4 and 34.1 BLEU points on the WMT14 English-German and German-English datasets, respectively.

Despite the success of the conventional supervised learning on individual datasets, such models often struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system cannot solve  classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build a model that learns a new task by understanding the human-readable instructions that define it. To study this, we introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61  distinct tasks, their human-authored instructions, and 193k task instances (input-output pairs). The instructions are obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to create  existing NLP datasets and mapped to a unified schema. Using this meta-dataset, we measure cross-task generalization by training models on seen tasks and measuring generalization to the remaining unseen ones. We adopt generative pre-trained language models to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output. Our results indicate that models benefit from instructions when evaluated in terms of generalization to unseen tasks (19% better for models utilizing instructions).

Recent advances in word embeddings have proven successful in learning entity representations from short texts, but fall short on longer documents because they do not capture full book-level information. To overcome the weakness of such text-based embeddings, we propose two novel methods for representing characters: (i) graph neural network-based embeddings from a full corpus-based character network; and (ii) low-dimensional embeddings constructed from the occurrence pattern of characters in each novel. We test the quality of these character embeddings using a new benchmark suite to evaluate character representations, encompassing 12 different tasks. We show that our representation techniques combined with text-based embeddings lead to the best character representations, outperforming text-based embeddings in four tasks.

We show there is still ample room for improvement in this task: the average plausibility of generated explanations assessed by human annotators is at most 51\%, while plausibility of human explanations is 76\%.

Dgt1yxotA-V,LPC: A Logits and Parameter Calibration Framework on Continual Learning,"Deep learning based pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) models typically pre-train on large unlabeled corpora first, then fine-tune on new tasks. When we execute such a paradigm on continuously sequential tasks, the model will suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem (i.e., they forget the parameters learned in previous tasks when we train the model on newly emerged tasks). Inspired by the idea of how humans learn things, we aim to maintain the old knowledge when we transfer to novel contents and calibrate the old and new knowledge. We propose a Logits and Parameter Calibration (LPC) framework to reduce the catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning process. The proposed framework includes two important components, the Logits Calibration (LC) and Parameter Calibration (PC). The core idea is to reduce the difference between old knowledge and new knowledge by doing calibration on logits and parameters so that the model can maintain old knowledge while learning new tasks without preserving data in previous tasks. First, we preserve the parameters learned from the base tasks. Second, we train the existing model on novel tasks and estimate the difference between base logits and parameters and novel logits and parameters.  Third, we drift from the base tasks to novel tasks gradually. Furthermore, we integrate the logtis and parameter calibration into a brand-new optimization algorithm. Finally, we do experiments on 7 scenarios of the GLUE (the General Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 7 scenarios.",december,True,0.7213500073538774,-12.355874744633542

Despite phenomenal progresses on general adversarial attacks, few works have investigated the vulnerability and adversarial attack specifically for QA. In this work, we first investigate the biases in the existing models and discover that they heavily rely on keyword matching and ignore the relevant entities from the question. TASA explores the two biases above and attacks the target model in two folds: (1) lowering the model's confidence on the gold answer with a perturbed answer sentence; (2) misguiding the model towards a wrong answer with a distracting answer sentence. Equipped with designed beam search and filtering methods, TASA is able to attack the target model efficiently while sustaining the quality of contexts. Extensive experiments on four QA datasets and human evaluations demonstrate that TASA generates substantial-high-quality attacks than existing textual adversarial attack methods.",december,True,-24.591800795263357,-19.56039485350368

Isolating Crucial Ingredients for Cross-lingual Transfer,"While recent work on multilingual language models has demonstrated their capacity for cross-lingual zero-shot transfer on downstream tasks, there is a lack of consensus in the community as to what shared properties between languages enable such transfer. Analyses involving pairs of natural languages are often inconclusive and contradictory since languages simultaneously differ in many linguistic aspects. In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to isolate the effects of various linguistic properties by measuring zero-shot transfer between four diverse natural languages and their counterparts constructed by modifying aspects such as the script, word order, and syntax. Among other things, our experiments show that the absence of sub-word overlap significantly affects zero-shot transfer when languages differ in their word order, and there is a strong correlation between transfer performance and word embedding alignment between languages (e.g., $\rho_s=0.94$ on the task of NLI). Our results call for focus in multilingual models on explicitly improving word embedding alignment between languages rather than relying on its implicit emergence.",december,True,11.136061787905259,-23.764328005157445

In this paper, we focus on extracting event arguments from an entire document, which mainly faces two critical problems: a) the long-distance dependency between trigger and arguments over sentences; b) the distracting context towards an event in the document. To address these issues, we propose a \textbf{T}wo-\textbf{S}tream \textbf{A}bstract meaning \textbf{R}epresentation enhanced extraction model (TSAR). TSAR encodes the document from different perspectives by a two-stream encoding module, to utilize local and global information and lower the impact of distracting context. Besides, TSAR introduces an AMR-guided interaction module to capture both intra-sentential and inter-sentential features, based on the locally and globally constructed AMR semantic graphs. An auxiliary boundary loss is introduced to enhance the boundary information for text spans explicitly. Extensive experiments illustrate that TSAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, with $2.54$ F1 and $5.13$ F1 performance gain on the public RAMS and WikiEvents datasets respectively, showing the superiority in the cross-sentence arguments extraction.

Existing approaches to solve MWPs require full supervision in the form of intermediate equations. However, labeling every MWP with its corresponding equations is a time-consuming and expensive task. In order to address this challenge of equation annotation, we propose a weakly supervised model for solving MWPs by requiring only the final answer as supervision. We approach this problem by first learning to generate the equation using the problem description and the final answer, which we subsequently use to train a supervised MWP solver. We propose and compare various weakly supervised techniques to learn to generate equations directly from the problem description and answer. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that without using equations for supervision, our approach achieves accuracy gains of 4.5% and 32% over the state-of-the-art weakly supervised approach (Hong et al., 2021), on the standard Math23K (Wang et al., 2017) and AllArith (Roy and Roth, 2017) datasets respectively.

The graph is initialised with corpus-trained multi-dimensional word and document node representation, and the relations are represented according to the distance of those words/documents nodes. Then, the generated graph is trained with ME-GCN, which considers the edge features as multi-stream signals, and each stream performs a separate graph convolutional operation.

Since rankings have multiple relevance factors and are aggregations of predictions,  existing approaches that use a single ranker might not be sufficient to approximate a complex model resulting in low local fidelity. In this paper, we overcome this problem by considering multiple simple rankers for better approximating the black box ranking model.  We pose the problem of local approximation as a Generalized Preference Coverage (GPC) problem that incorporates multiple simple rankers towards the post-hoc interpretability of ranking models. Our approach Multiplex uses a linear programming approach to judiciously extract the explanation terms. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of ranking models and report fidelity improvements of $37\% - 54\%$ over existing baselines and competitors.

In this work, however, we demonstrate that EMSL reduces robustness, rendering models vulnerable to synonym substitution and typos. Instead of relying on EMSL to make up for deficiencies in question-schema encoding, we show that by utilizing the pre-trained language model as the encoder, we can improve the performance without using EMSL, and thus the model is more robust. Our experiments suggest that EMSL is not the icing on the cake, but it is the one that introduces the vulnerability, and it can be replaced by better input encoding.",december,True,16.479620347252492,0.19397390785185156

While attention has been widely used in VL tasks, it has not been examined the capability of different attention alignment calculation in bridging the semantic gap between visual and textual clues. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on understanding the role of attention alignment by looking into the attention score calculation methods and check how it actually represents the visual region's and textual token's significance for the global assessment. We also analyse the conditions which attention score calculation mechanism would be more (or less) interpretable, and which may impact the model performance on three different VL tasks, including visual question answering, text-to-image generation, text-and-image matching (both sentence and image retrieval).

L3TcOq4D2cD,Is syntax structure modeling worth? Leveraging pattern-driven modeling to enable affordable sentiment dependency learning,"Is structure information modeling really worth in Aspect-based sentiment classification (ABSC)? Recent popular works tend to exploit syntactic information guiding sentiment dependency parsing, i.e., structure-based sentiment dependency learning. However, many works fall into the trap that confusing the concepts between syntax dependency and sentiment dependency. Besides, structure information (e.g., syntactic dependency tree) usually consumes expensive computational resources due to the extraction of the adjacent matrix. Instead, we believe the sentiment dependency mostly occurs between adjacent aspects. By proposing the sentiment patterns (SP) to boost the sentiment dependency learning, we introduce the Local dependency aggregating (Lena) to explore sentiment dependency in the text. Experiments show that Lena is more efficient than existing structure-based models without dependency matrix constructing and modeling expense. The performance on all five public ABSC datasets makes a big step compared to state-of-the-art models, and our work could inspire future research focusing on efficient local sentient dependency modeling.",december,True,-26.64019540811438,25.270406737516645

In this paper, we explore whether different transformer models are capable of identifying aspectual features. We focus on two specific aspectual features: telicity and duration. Telicity marks whether the verb's action or state has an endpoint or not (telic/atelic), and duration denotes whether a verb expresses an action (dynamic) or a state (stative). These features are integral to the interpretation of natural language, but also hard to annotate and identify with NLP methods. We perform experiments in English and French, and our results show that transformer models adequately capture information on telicity and duration in their vectors, even in their non-finetuned forms, but are somewhat biased with regard to verb tense and word order.

Most existing storytelling approaches have evaluated their models using traditional natural language generation metrics like BLEU or CIDEr. However, such metrics based on $n$-gram matching tend to have poor correlation with human evaluation scores and do not explicitly consider other criteria necessary for storytelling such as sentence structure or topic coherence. Moreover, a single score is not enough to assess a story as it does not inform us about what specific errors were made by the model. In this paper, we propose 3 evaluation metrics sets that analyses which aspects we would look for in a good story: 1) visual grounding, 2) coherence, and 3) non-redundancy. We measure the reliability of our metric sets by analysing its correlation with human judgement scores on a sample of machine stories obtained from 4 state-of-the-arts models trained on the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST).

However, current approaches for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks use CL to improve in-domain model performance often via metrics that are detached from the model one aims to improve. In this work, instead, we employ CL for NLU by taking advantage of training dynamics as difficulty metrics, i.e. statistics that measure the behavior of the model at hand on data instances during training. In addition, we propose two modifications of existing CL schedulers based on these statistics. Differently from existing works, we focus on evaluating models on out-of-distribution data as well as languages other than English via zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. We show across four XNLU tasks that CL with training dynamics in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings can achieve significant speedups up to 58%. We also find that performance can be improved on challenging tasks, with OOD generalisation up by 8\% and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer up by 1%. Overall, experiments indicate that training dynamics can lead to better performing models and smoother training compared to other difficulty metrics.

Towards the above issues, we propose a novel heterogeneous-graph reasoning and fine-grained aggregation model, with two following modules: 1) a heterogeneous graph attention network module to distinguish different types of relationships within the constructed graph; 2) fine-grained aggregation module which learns the implicit stance of evidences towards the prediction result in details.

This paper introduces iterative decoding, an alternative to seq2seq that (i) improves transformer compositional generalization in the PCFG and Cartesian product datasets and (ii) evidences that, in these datasets, seq2seq transformers do not learn iterations that are not unrolled. In iterative decoding, training examples are broken down into a sequence of intermediate steps that the transformer learns iteratively. At inference time, the intermediate outputs are fed back to the transformer as intermediate inputs until an end-of-iteration token is predicted. We conclude by illustrating some limitations of iterative decoding in the CFQ dataset.",december,True,19.576372901588922,-4.859987979689751

Though seq2seq models can perform well on lexical tasks, they perform with near-zero accuracy on structural generalization tasks that require novel syntactic structures; this holds true even when they are trained to predict syntax instead of semantics. In contrast, compositional models achieve near-perfect accuracy on structural generalization; we present new results confirming this from the AM parser (Groschwitz et al., 2021).

Existing debiasing methods for classification models, such as adversarial training, are often expensive to train and fragile to optimise. Here, we propose a method for mitigating bias in classifier training by incorporating contrastive learning, in which instances sharing the same class label are encouraged to have similar representations, while instances sharing a protected attribute are forced further apart. In such a way our method learns representations that capture the task label in focused regions, while ensuring the protected attribute has diverse spread, and thus has limited impact on prediction and thereby results in fairer models. Extensive experimental results on three tasks show that: our method achieves fairer representations larger bias reduction than competitive baselines; it does so without sacrificing main task performance; and it generalizes across modalities and binary- and multi-class classification tasks, being conceptually simple and agnostic to network architecture, and incurring minimal additional compute cost.",december,True,10.654141756473246,-11.92267131092732

To the best of our knowledge, how the agents perceive the multimodal input is under-studied and needs investigation. In this work, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments to unveil agents' focus during navigation. Results show that indoor navigation agents refer to both object and direction tokens when making decisions. In contrast, outdoor navigation agents heavily rely on direction tokens and poorly understand the object tokens. The differences in dataset designs and the visual features lead to distinct behaviors on visual environment understanding. Many models claim that they can align object tokens with specific visual targets when it comes to vision-and-language alignments. We find unbalanced attention on the vision and text input and doubt the reliability of such cross-modal alignments.",december,True,38.067223442412576,-4.522102425681248

Previous works have sought to design supervised neural text generation models to solve the biomedical terminology generation task, but most of them failed to define never-before-seen terminologies in newly emerging research fields. Here, we tackle this challenge by introducing a zero-shot definition generation model based on prompting, a recent approach for eliciting knowledge from pre-trained language models, with automatically generated prompts. Furthermore, we enhanced the biomedical terminology dataset by adding descriptive texts to each biomedical subdiscipline, thus enabling zero-shot learning scenarios.

qitQJKkhEZj,A Survey on Multimodal Disinformation Detection,"Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of offensive content online such as fake news, propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation. While initially this was mostly about textual content, over time images and videos gained popularity, as they are much easier to consume, attract more attention, and spread further than simple text. As a result, researchers started leveraging different modalities and combinations thereof to combat online multimodal offensive content. In this study,  we offer a survey that carefully studies the state-of-the-art on multimodal disinformation detection covering various combinations of modalities: text, images, speech, video, social media network structure, and temporal information. Moreover, while some studies focused on factuality, others investigated how harmful the content is. While these two components in the definition of disinformation -- (i) factuality, and (ii) harmfulness, are equally important, they are typically studied in isolation. Thus, we argue for the need to tackle disinformation detection by taking into account multiple modalities as well as both factuality and harmfulness, in the same framework. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future research directions.",december,True,-2.4277815044914997,34.62054855525624

15ZiKr2oSkC,Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Authentic Dialogue Generation To Protect Youth From Cybergrooming,"Cybergrooming is defined as a crime towards potential victims, especially teens, by building close personal relationships with them with the purpose of sexual exploitation via online media. Cyber or online sexual grooming has been recognized as a serious cyber crime. However, there have been insufficient programs to proactively protect the youth from cybergrooming.  In this work, we present a generative chatbot framework, called SERI (Stop cybERgroomIng), that can generate simulated conversations between a perpetrator chatbot and a potential victim chatbot.  To realize the simulation of authentic conversations in the context of cybergrooming, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dialogue generation for authentic simulation of the conversations between a potential victim and a perpetrator (i.e., cybergroomer).  The design of the SERI is motivated to ensure a safe and authentic environment to strengthen the youth's precautionary awareness of cybergrooming while any unnecessary ethical issues (e.g., the potential misuse of the SERI) are removed or minimized.  We developed the SERI as a preliminary platform that can deploy the perpetrator chatbot to interact with human users (i.e., youth) to observe youth users' responses to strangers or acquaintances and collect the reactions when the youth users are asked for private or sensitive information by the perpetrator. We evaluated the quality of conversations generated by the SERI based on open-source, referenced, unreferenced metrics, and human evaluation. ",december,True,22.562765639114247,15.376926262952496

Based on our corpus, we propose an unsupervised method for hyperbole generation that does not require parallel literal-hyperbole pairs. During training, we fine-tune BART to infill masked hyperbolic spans of sentences from HYPO-XL. During inference, we mask part of an input literal sentence and over-generate multiple possible hyperbolic versions.

TAGS-DC is composed of masking and refilling to generate synthetic negative sentences with higher difficulty. To keep the difficulty during training, we mutually improve the retrieval and generation through parameter sharing.

Due to the complex nature of social bias, we argue it is important to study how different biases interact with each other, i.e., how mitigating one bias type (e.g., gender) influences the bias results regarding other social identities (e.g., race and religion). We further question whether jointly debiasing multiple types of bias is desired in different contexts, e.g., when correlations between biases are different. To address these research questions, we examine bias mitigation in two NLP tasks -- toxicity detection and word embeddings -- on three social identities, i.e., race, gender, and religion. Empirical findings based on benchmark datasets suggest that different biases can be correlated and therefore, warranting attention for future research on joint bias mitigation.",december,True,11.97658950211081,-12.8613400293531

Adversarial dataset creation has been proposed as a strategy to construct more challenging datasets, and two common approaches are: (1) filtering out easy examples and (2) model-in-the-loop data collection. In this work, we study the impact of applying each approach to create more challenging evaluation datasets. We adapt the AFLite algorithm to filter evaluation data, and run experiments against 18 different adversary models. We find that AFLite indeed selects more challenging examples, lowering the performance of evaluated models more as stronger adversary models are used. However, the resulting ranking of models can also be unstable and highly sensitive to the choice of adversary model used. Moreover, AFLite oversamples examples with low annotator agreement, meaning that model comparisons hinge on the most contentiously labeled examples. Smaller-scale experiments on the adversarially collected datasets ANLI and AdversarialQA show similar findings, broadly lowering performance with stronger adversaries while disproportionately affecting the adversary model.",december,True,7.071201325394588,-7.8695550622041255

Such co-citations not only reflect close paper relatedness, but also provide textual descriptions of how the co-cited papers are related. This novel form of textual supervision is used for learning to match aspects across papers. We develop multi-vector representations where vectors correspond to sentence-level aspects of documents, and present two methods for aspect matching: (1) A fast method that only matches single aspects, and (2) a method that makes sparse multiple matches with an Optimal Transport mechanism that computes an Earth Mover's Distance between aspects.

Inspired by this, we propose a two-stage translation prototype -- Hybrid-Regressive Translation (HRT) to combine the strengths of autoregressive and non-autoregressive. Specifically, HRT first generates a discontinuous sequence by autoregression (e.g., make a prediction every k tokens, k>1) and then fills all previously skipped tokens at once in a non-autoregressive manner. We also propose a bag of techniques to effectively and efficiently train HRT, with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results on WMT En-Ro, En-De, and NIST Zh-En show that our model outperforms existing semi-autoregressive models and is competitive with current state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models.

h7FcdZf07sT,Improving Tokenisation by Alternative Treatment of Spaces,"Tokenisation is the first step in almost all NLP tasks, and state-of-the-art transformer-based language models all use subword tokenisation algorithms to process input text. Existing algorithms have problems, often producing tokenisations of limited linguistic validity, and representing equivalent strings differently depending on their position within a word. We hypothesise that these problems hinder the ability of transformer-based models to handle complex words, and suggest that these problems are a result of allowing tokens to include spaces. We thus experiment with an alternative tokenisation approach where spaces are always treated as individual tokens, finding it alleviates existing problems, improving performance of models. Concretely, we apply a modification to the BPE and Unigram algorithms which implements this approach, and find it gives more morphologically correct tokenisations, in particular when handling prefixes. In addition, we show that the modified algorithms give improved performance on downstream NLP tasks that involve handling complex words, whilst having no detrimental effect on performance in general natural language understanding tasks.

That is, a parallel dataset with document-summary pairs is not required to train the proposed model.

D2mnbjkpk1-,Learning to Win Lottery Tickets in BERT Transfer via Task-agnostic Mask Training,"Recent studies on the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) show that pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT contain matching subnetworks that have similar transfer learning performance as the original PLM. These subnetworks are found using magnitude-based pruning. In this paper, we find that the BERT subnetworks have even more potential than these studies have shown. Firstly, we discover that the success of magnitude pruning can be attributed to the preserved pre-training performance, which correlates with the downstream transferability. Inspired by this, we propose to directly optimize the subnetwork structure towards the pre-training objectives, which can better preserve the pre-training performance. Specifically, we train binary masks over model weights on the pre-training tasks, with the aim of preserving the universal transferability of the subnetwork, which is agnostic to any specific downstream tasks. We then fine-tune the subnetworks on the GLUE benchmark and the SQuAD dataset. The results show that, compared with magnitude pruning, mask training can effectively find BERT subnetworks with improved overall performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, our method is also more efficient in searching subnetworks and more advantageous when fine-tuning within a certain range of data scarcity. Our code will be released upon publication.",december,True,-10.86816119806098,-24.045817264005848

6Lf2H-Bx59N,Anticipation-free Training for Simultaneous Translation,"Simultaneous translation (SimulMT) speeds up the translation process by starting to translate before the source sentence is completely available. It is difficult due to limited context and word order difference between languages. Existing methods increase latency or introduce adaptive read-write policies for SimulMT models to handle local reordering and improve translation quality. However, the long-distance reordering would make the SimulMT models learn translation mistakenly. Specifically, the model may be forced to predict target tokens when the corresponding source tokens have not been read. This leads to aggressive anticipation during inference, resulting in the hallucination phenomenon. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new framework that decompose the translation process into the monotonic translation step and the reordering step, and we model the latter by the auxiliary sorting network (ASN). The ASN rearranges the hidden states to match the order in the target language, so that the SimulMT model could learn to translate more reasonably. The entire model is optimized end-to-end and does not rely on external aligners or data. During inference, ASN is removed to achieve streaming. Experiments show the proposed framework could outperform previous methods with less latency.",december,True,18.35061714757502,-28.32282425001712

In models with correctable errors of the first type, we show that targeted supervision can address them.

Existing approaches only learn class-specific semantic features and intermediate representations from source domains. This affects generalizability to unseen target domains, resulting in suboptimal performances. To this end, we present CONTaiNER, a novel contrastive learning technique that optimizes the inter-token distribution distance for Few-Shot NER. Instead of optimizing class-specific attributes, CONTaiNER optimizes a generalized objective of differentiating between token categories based on their Gaussian-distributed embeddings. This effectively alleviates overfitting issues originating from training domains. Our experiments in several traditional test domains (OntoNotes, CoNLL'03, WNUT '17, GUM) and a new large scale Few-Shot NER dataset (Few-NERD) demonstrate that on average, CONTaiNER outperforms previous methods by 3%-13% absolute F1 points while showing consistent performance trends, even in challenging scenarios where previous approaches could not achieve appreciable performance.

EtZ9h4Lqs5-,A Few Thousand Translations Go a Long Way! Leveraging Pre-trained Models for African News Translation,"Recent advances in the pre-training for language models leverage large-scale datasets to create multilingual models. However, low-resource languages are  mostly left out in these datasets. This is primarily because many widely spoken languages that are not be well represented on the web and therefore excluded from the large-scale crawls for datasets. Furthermore, downstream users of these models are restricted to the selection of languages originally chosen for pre-training. This work investigates how to optimally leverage existing pre-trained models to create low-resource translation systems for 16 African languages. We focus on two questions: 1) How can pre-trained models be used for languages not included in the initial pretraining? and 2) How can the resulting translation models effectively transfer to new domains? To answer these questions, we create a novel African news corpus covering 16 languages, of which eight languages are not part of any existing evaluation dataset. We demonstrate that the most effective strategy for transferring both additional languages and additional domains is to leverage small quantities of high-quality translation data to fine-tune large pre-trained models.",january,True,6.513993956066107,-28.237220134173285

The information stream such channels contain can be used to detect and describe the ongoing events to take informed decisions in numerous domains. A typical framework for event detection is to first cluster the stream of tweets, and then analyze the clusters to decide which deal with real-world events. In this context, content representation models and clustering approaches are critical. Classical approaches are usually based on TF-IDF for the representation of the text content and on dynamic clustering for the clustering part. In this paper, we propose to compare TF-IDF with recent text representation models and we propose an event detection method based on conventional clustering. We show that, contrary to previous results, language models based on Transformer architectures are competitive with TF-IDF.

In this work, we approach language change through the lens of causality in order to model not only how various distributional factors associate with language change, but how they causally affect it. In particular, we study slang, which is an informal language that is typically restricted to a specific group or social setting. We analyze the semantic change and frequency shift of slang words and compare them to those of standard, nonslang words. With causal discovery and causal inference techniques, we measure the effect that word type (slang/nonslang) has on both semantic change and frequency shift, as well as its relationship to frequency, polysemy and part of speech. Our analysis provides some new insights in the study of semantic change, e.g., we show that slang words undergo less semantic change but tend to have larger frequency shifts over time.",january,True,1.0708028162874066,-32.45334835592208

However, to date the majority of the approaches to detect these attacks have been designed for image processing systems. Many popular image adversarial detection approaches are able to identify adversarial examples from embedding feature spaces, whilst in the NLP domain existing state of the art detection approaches solely focus on input text features, without consideration of model embedding spaces. This work examines what differences result when porting these image designed strategies to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks - these detectors are found to not port over well. This is expected as NLP systems have a very different form of input: discrete and sequential in nature, rather than the continuous and fixed size inputs for images. As an equivalent model-focused NLP detection approach, this work proposes a simple sentence-embedding ""residue"" based  detector to identify adversarial examples.

However, they require large amounts of training data which is not available for most domains. As shown in previous work (Thakur et al., 2021b), the performance of dense retrievers severely degrades under a domain shift. This limits the usage of dense retrieval approaches to only a few domains with large training datasets.  In this paper, we propose the novel unsupervised domain adaptation method Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL), which combines a query generator with pseudo labeling from a cross-encoder. On six representative domain-specialized datasets, we find the proposed GPL can outperform an out-of-the-box state-of-the-art dense retrieval approach by up to 8.9 points nDCG@10. GPL requires less (unlabeled) data from the target domain and is more robust in its training than previous methods.  We further investigate the role of six recent pre-training methods in the scenario of domain adaptation for retrieval tasks, where only three could yield improved results.

Unlike the previous studies that focus on one language at a time when target-adapting, we use one model to handle all target languages simultaneously to avoid excessively language-specific models. Moreover, we discuss the unreality of utilizing large target development sets for model selection in previous literature, and further show that our method is development-free for target languages and also able to escape from overfitting issues. We conduct a large-scale experiment on 4 diverse NLP tasks across up to 48 languages. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks and outperforms target-adapting by a large margin, especially for languages that are linguistically distant from the source language, e.g., an average of 7.36% absolute F1 improvement on the NER task, up to a gain of 17.60% on Punjabi.",january,True,9.270885351139562,-19.188346858271423

However, the selection model with over-reliance only on superficial features is vulnerable to adversarial responses that are semantically similar but irrelevant to dialogue context. Recent studies have shown that leveraging these adversarial responses as negative training samples is useful for improving the robustness of the selection model. Nevertheless, existing methods often require further fine-tuning for data creation or have limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a simple but effective method for generating adversarial negative responses leveraging a large-scale language model. Our method can generate realistic negative responses only with a few human-written examples and a prompt designed to optimize generation quality. Experimental results on the dialogue selection task show that our method outperforms existing methods for creating negative responses.

YTxDTt2aPnF,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Event Detection via Meta Self-Paced Learning,"A shift in data distribution can have a significant impact on performance of a model to detect important events in text. Recent methods addressing unsupervised domain adaptation for event detection task typically extracted domain-invariant representations through balancing between various objectives to align feature spaces between source and target domains. While effective, these methods are impractical as large-scale language models are drastically growing bigger to achieve optimal performance. To this end, we propose to leverage meta-learning framework to train a neural network-based self-paced learning procedure in an end-to-end manner. Our method, called Meta Self-Paced Domain Adaption (MSP-DA), effectively tunes domain-specific hyperparameters including learning schedules, sample weights, and objective balancing coefficients, simultaneously throughout the learning process, by imitating the train-test dataset split based on the difficulties of source domain's samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework substantially improves performance on target domains, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. Detailed analyses validate our method and provide insight into how each domain affects the learned hyperparameters.",january,True,15.012102447214355,9.69917238051793

ocsgIiRIxxO,Template-free Prompt Tuning for Few-shot NER,"Prompt-based methods have been successfully applied in sentence-level few-shot learning tasks, mostly owing to the sophisticated design of templates and label words. However, when applied to token-level labeling tasks such as NER, it would be time-consuming to enumerate the template queries over all potential entity spans. In this work, we propose a more elegant method to reformulate NER tasks as LM problems without any templates. Specifically, we discard the template construction process while maintaining the word prediction paradigm of pre-training models to predict a class-related pivot word (or label word) at the entity position. Meanwhile, we also explore principled ways to automatically search for appropriate label words that the pre-trained models can easily adapt to. While avoiding the complicated template-based process, the proposed LM objective also reduces the gap between different objectives used in pre-training and fine-tuning, thus it can better benefit the few-shot performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over bert-tagger and template-based method under few-shot settings. Moreover, the decoding speed of the proposed method is up to 1930.12 times faster than the template-based method.",january,True,-2.7573162366800084,-26.36715594278805

JhU9onUBeC,Multi2WOZ: A Robust Multilingual Dataset and Conversational Pretraining for Task-Oriented Dialog,"Research on (multi-domain) task-oriented dialog (TOD) has predominantly focused on the English language, primarily due to the shortage of robust TOD datasets in other languages, preventing the systematic investigation of cross-lingual transfer for this crucial NLP application area. In this work, we introduce Multi2WOZ, a new multilingual multi-domain TOD dataset, derived from the well-established English dataset MultiWOZ, that spans four typologically diverse languages: Chinese, German, Arabic, and Russian. In contrast to concurrent efforts, Multi2WOZ contains gold-standard dialogs in target languages that are directly comparable with development and test portions of the English dataset, enabling reliable and comparative estimates of cross-lingual transfer performance for TOD. This enables us to detect and explore crucial challenges for TOD cross-lingually. We then introduce a new framework for multilingual conversational specialization of pretrained language models (PrLMs) that aims to facilitate cross-lingual transfer for arbitrary downstream TOD tasks. Using such conversational PrLMs specialized for concrete target languages, we systematically benchmark a number of zero-shot and few-shot cross-lingual transfer approaches on two standard TOD tasks: Dialog State Tracking and Response Retrieval. Our experiments show that, in most setups, the best performance entails the combination of (i) conversational specialization in the target language and (ii) few-shot transfer for the concrete TOD task. Most importantly, we show that our conversational specialization in the target language allows for a much more sample-efficient few-shot transfer for downstream TOD tasks.",january,True,12.931407411417313,-33.65247907267584

Recently, there has been much interest in non-autoregressive (NAR) models, which promise faster translation. In parallel to the research on NAR models, there have been successful attempts to create optimized autoregressive models as part of the WMT shared task on efficient translation. In this paper, we point out flaws in the evaluation methodology present in the literature on NAR models and we provide fair comparison between a state-of-the-art NAR model and the autoregressive submissions to the shared task. We make the case for consistent evaluation of NAR models, and also for the importance of comparing NAR models  with other widely used efficiency approaches. We run experiments with a connectionist-temporal-classification-based (CTC) NAR model implemented in C++ and compare it with AR models using wall clock times. Our results show that, although NAR models are faster on GPUs, with small batch sizes, they are nearly always slower under more realistic usage conditions.

KjmdDULiokJ,Co-training an Unsupervised Constituency Parser with Weak Supervision,"We introduce a method for unsupervised parsing that relies on bootstrapping classifiers to identify if a node dominates a specific span in a sentence. There are two types of classifiers, an inside classifier that acts on a span, and an outside classifier that acts on everything outside of a given span. Through self-training and co-training with the two classifiers, we show that the interplay between them helps improve the accuracy of both, and as a result, effectively parse. A seed bootstrapping technique prepares the data to train these classifiers. Our analyses further validate that such an approach in conjunction with weak supervision using prior branching knowledge of a known language (left/right-branching) and minimal heuristics injects strong inductive bias into the parser, achieving 63.1 F$_1$ on the English (PTB) test set. In addition, we show the effectiveness of our architecture by evaluating on treebanks for Chinese (CTB) and Japanese (KTB) and achieve new state-of-the-art results.\footnote{For code or data, please contact the authors.}",january,True,29.094614314391475,8.345753975358441

Work in explainable AI must balance competing objectives along two different axes: 1) Models should ideally be both accurate and simple. 2) Explanations must balance faithfulness to the model's decision-making with their plausibility to a domain expert.

In this work, we introduce \textit{commonsense knowledge transfer}, a framework to transfer the commonsense knowledge stored in a neural commonsense knowledge model to a general-purpose pre-trained language model. It first exploits general texts to form queries for extracting commonsense knowledge from the neural commonsense knowledge model and then refines the language model with two self-supervised objectives: \textit{commonsense mask infilling} and \textit{commonsense relation prediction}, which align human language with the underlying commonsense knowledge. Empirical results show that our approach consistently improves the model's performance on downstream tasks that require commonsense reasoning. Moreover, we find that the improvement is more significant in the few-shot setting. This suggests that our approach helps language models better transfer to downstream tasks without extensive supervision by injecting commonsense knowledge into their parameters.

pPTZJQ7U_iX,"Revisiting Additive Compositionality: AND, OR, and NOT Operations with Word Embeddings","It is well-known that typical word embedding methods have the property that the meaning can be composed by adding up the embeddings (additive compositionality). Several theories have been proposed to explain additive compositionality, but the following problems remain: (i) The assumptions of those theories do not hold for the practical word embedding. (ii) Ordinary additive compositionality can be seen as an AND operation of word meanings, but it is not well understood how other operations, such as OR and NOT, can be computed by the embeddings. We address these issues by the idea of frequency-weighted centering at its core. This method bridges the gap between practical word embedding and the assumption of theory about additive compositionality as an answer to (i). This paper also gives a method for taking OR or NOT of the meaning by linear operation of word embedding as an answer to (ii). Moreover, we confirm experimentally that the accuracy of AND operation, i.e., the ordinary additive compositionality, can be improved by our post-processing method (3.5x improvement in top-100 accuracy) and that OR and NOT operations can be performed correctly.

Existing attacks are usually realized through word-level or sentence-level perturbations, which either limit the perturbation space or sacrifices fluency and textual quality, both affecting the attack effectiveness. In this paper, we propose PLAT that generates adversarial samples through phrase-level perturbations. PLAT first extracts the vulnerable phrases as attack targets by a syntactic parser, and then perturbs them by a pretrained blank-infilling model. Such flexible perturbation design substantially expands the search space for more effective attacks without introducing too many modifications, and meanwhile maintains the textual fluency and grammaticality via contextualized generation using surrounding texts. Moreover, we develop a label-preservation filter leveraging the likelihoods of language models finetuned on each class to rule out those perturbations that potentially alter the original class label for humans. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that PLAT has a superior attack efficiency as well as a better label consistency than strong baselines.",january,True,-22.338980827502173,-19.084230901630505

Existing personalized dialogue systems have tried to extract user profiles from dialogue history to guide personalized response generation. Since the dialogue history is usually long and noisy, most existing methods truncate the dialogue history to model the user personality. Such methods can generate some personalized responses, but a large part of dialogue history is wasted, leading to sub-optimal performance of personalized response generation. In this work, we propose to refine the user dialogue history from a large scale, based on which we can handle more dialogue history and obtain a more abundant and accurate persona information. Specifically, we design an MSP model which consists of three personal information refiners and a personalized response generator. With these multi-level refiners, we can sparsely extract the most valuable information (tokens) from the dialogue history and leverage other similar users' data to enhance the personalization. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating more informative and personalized responses.",january,True,-16.07469891526576,13.470649472009804

To facilitate their use, we develop a query rewriting model CONQRR that rewrites a conversational question in the context into a standalone question. It is trained with a novel reward function to directly optimize towards retrieval using reinforcement learning and can be adapted to any fixed retriever. We show that CONQRR achieves state-of-the-art results on a recent open-domain CQA dataset containing conversations from three different sources, and is effective for two different fixed retrievers.

CSP aims to discover customer satisfaction according to the dialogue content of customer and customer service, for the purpose of improving service quality and customer experience.

Also, prior studies find that when people have credible source of information, they are likely to use a more confident textual tone in their spreading of rumors. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a double-channel structure to determine the ex-ante veracity of rumors on social media. Our ultimate goal is to classify each rumor into true, false, or unverifiable. We first assign each text into either certain (informed rumor) or uncertain (uninformed rumor) category. Then, we apply lie detection algorithm to informed rumors and thread-reply agreement detection algorithm to uninformed rumors. Using the dataset of SemEval 2019 Task 7, which requires ex-ante threefold classification (true, false, or unverifiable) of social media rumors, our model yields a macro-F1 score of 0.4027, outperforming all the baseline models and the second-place winner (Gorrell et al., 2019).

However, the large number of parameters in the resulting models makes building and using them prohibitive without access to high-performing processing units with large memory capacity. We propose an alternative approach that can create efficient representations without the need for a neural visual backbone. This leads to an 80% reduction in the number of parameters compared to the smallest SOTA model, widely expanding applicability. Despite using 2.5% of training data, we show competitive performance on two form understanding tasks: semantic labeling and link prediction.",january,True,5.920702705280984,-13.048224201029395

qQslHiBlEOX,Quantifying Adaptability in Pre-trained Language Models with 500 Tasks,"When a neural language model (LM) is adapted to perform a new task, what aspects of the task predict the eventual performance of the model? In NLP, systematic features of LM generalization to individual examples are well characterized, but systematic aspects of LM adaptability to new tasks are not nearly as well understood. We present a large-scale empirical study of the features and limits of LM adaptability using a new benchmark, TaskBench500, built from 500 procedurally generated sequence modeling tasks. These tasks combine core aspects of language processing, including lexical semantics, sequence processing, memorization, logical reasoning, and world knowledge. Using TaskBench500, we evaluate three facets of adaptability, finding that: (1) adaptation procedures differ dramatically in their ability to memorize small datasets; (2) within a subset of task types, adaptation procedures exhibit compositional adaptability to complex tasks; and (3) failure to match training label distributions is explained by mismatches in the intrinsic difficulty of predicting individual labels. Our experiments show that adaptability to new tasks, like generalization to new examples, can be systematically described and understood, and we conclude with a discussion of additional aspects of adaptability that could be studied using the new benchmark.",january,True,-0.5351655625298726,-20.364454697008316

Existing works in open-ended CRS mainly focus on recommendation and generation, but lacks of control over dialogue policy. In addition, the system is unable to adapt user profile to the user's feedback. Thus, we present a new dataset named DA-ReDial (Recommendation through Dialogue guided by Dialogue Act). We  summarize 10 representative Dialog Acts and label dialogue with the DAs schema. To solve the problems above, we also propose a novel CRS called PGCR which stands for Policy-Guided Conversational Recommendation. It is able to formulate a DA-aware user profile, leverage Dialogue Acts to explicitly model the discourse structure of conversation and better guide the response generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset show that our proposed model outperforms most baselines in dialog generation and recommendation. Also, the Policy Network fine-tuned by self-play can better control the dialogue policy and contribute a lot to recommendation strategy and user engagement in conversation.

Xg0hWle2l-c,A Generative Language Model for Few-shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing. In recent works, pre-trained language models are often used to achieve state-of-the-art results, especially when training data is scarce. It is common to fine-tune on the downstream task, usually by adding task-specific layers on top of the model. In this paper, we focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis, which involves extracting aspect term, category, and predicting their corresponding polarities. In particular, we are interested in few-shot settings. We propose to reformulate the extraction and prediction tasks into the sequence generation task, using a generative language model with unidirectional attention (GPT2 is used unless stated otherwise). This way, the model learns to accomplish the tasks via language generation without the need of training task-specific layers. Our evaluation results on the single-task polarity prediction show that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (based on BERT) on average performance by a large margins in few-shot and full-shot settings. More importantly, our generative approach significantly reduces the model variance caused by  low-resource data. We further demonstrate that the proposed generative language model can handle joint and multi-tasking settings, unlike previous work. We observe that the proposed sequence generation method achieves further improved performances on polarity prediction when the model is trained via joint and multi-tasking settings. Further evaluation on similar sentiment analysis datasets, SST-2, SST-5 and OOS intent detection validates the superiority and noise robustness of generative language model in few-shot settings.",january,True,-25.60459545807784,22.219230352671637
rjGyTukm78q,CoMPM: Context Modeling with Speaker's Pre-trained Memory Tracking for Emotion Recognition in Conversation,"As the use of interactive machines grow, the task of Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) became more important. If the machine-generated sentences reflect emotion, more human-like sympathetic conversations are possible. Since emotion recognition in conversation is inaccurate if the previous utterances are not taken into account, many studies reflect the dialogue context to improve the performances. Many recent approaches show performance improvement by combining knowledge into modules learned from external structured data. However, structured data is difficult to access in non-English languages, making it difficult to extend to other languages. Therefore, we extract the pre-trained memory using the pre-trained language model as an extractor of external knowledge. We introduce CoMPM, which combines the speaker's pre-trained memory with the context model, and find that the pre-trained memory significantly improves the performance of the context model. CoMPM achieves the first or second performance on all data and is state-of-the-art among systems that do not leverage structured data.

_LCSeFudYuR,Guiding Topic Flows in the Generative Chatbot by Enhancing the ConceptNet with the Conversation Corpora,"Human conversations consist of reasonable and natural topic flows, which are observed as the shifts of the mentioned concepts across utterances. Previous chatbots that incorporate the external commonsense knowledge graph prove that modeling the concept shifts can effectively alleviate the dull and uninformative response dilemma. However, there still exists a gap between the concept relations in the natural conversation and those in the external commonsense knowledge graph.  Specifically, the concept relations in the external commonsense knowledge graph are not intuitively built from the conversational scenario but the world knowledge, which makes them insufficient for the chatbot construction. To bridge the above gap, we propose the method to supply more concept relations extracted from the conversational corpora and build an enhanced concept graph for the chatbot construction. We then introduce the enhanced graph to the response generation process with a designed network. Experimental results on the Reddit conversation dataset indicate our proposed method significantly outperforms strong baseline systems and achieves new SOTA results.

Specifically, a content planning module is trained on non-poetic texts to obtain discourse-level coherence; then a rhyme module generates rhyme words and a polishing module introduces imagery and similes for aesthetics purposes. Finally, we design a constrained decoding algorithm to impose the meter-and-rhyme constraint of the generated sonnets. Automatic and human evaluation show that our multi-stage approach without training on poem corpora generates more coherent, poetic, and creative sonnets than several strong baselines.",january,True,21.046386966848296,0.23962817933657296

Recent research found it beneficial to use large state spaces for HMMs and PCFGs. However, inference with large state spaces is computationally demanding, especially for PCFGs. To tackle this challenge, we leverage tensor rank decomposition (aka. CPD) to decrease inference computational complexities for a subset of FGGs subsuming HMMs and PCFGs. We apply CPD on the factors of an FGG and then construct a new FGG defined in the rank space. Inference with the new FGG produces the same result but has a lower time complexity when the rank size is smaller than the state size. We conduct experiments on HMM language modeling and unsupervised PCFG parsing, showing better performance than previous work.

In this work, we further investigate the marriage between semi-supervised learning and a pre-trained language model. Unlike existing approaches that utilize PLMs only for model parameter initialization, we explore the inherent topic matching capability inside PLMs for building a more powerful semi-supervised learning approach. Specifically, we propose a joint semi-supervised learning process that can progressively build a standard $K$-way classifier and a matching network for the input text and the Class Semantic Representation (CSR). The CSR will be initialized from the given labeled sentences and progressively updated through the training process.

Discovering these priorities is helpful for automated negotiation systems deployed in pedagogy and conversational AI.

The model takes in a partial dialogue as input and predicts the priority order of the opponent. We further devise ways to adapt related data sources for this task to provide more explicit supervision for incorporating the opponent preferences and offers, as a proxy to relying on granular utterance-level annotations. We show the utility of our proposed approach through extensive experiments based on two dialogue datasets.

Z1Vgh4I_5ur,Table Retrieval Does Not Necessitate Table-specific Model Design,"Tables are an important form of structured data for both human and machine readers alike, providing answers to questions that cannot, or cannot easily, be found in texts. Recent work designs special models and trains for table-related tasks such as table-based question answering and table retrieval. Though effective, they add model-data dual complexity to generic text solutions and obscure which elements are truly beneficial.  In this work, we focus on the task of table retrieval, and ask: ``are table-specific model designs necessary for table retrieval, or can a text-generic model be effectively used to achieve a similar result?’’ We start by analyzing NQ-table, a set of table-answerable questions in the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, and find 90\% of the questions can match tables in content with little concern for table structure. Motivated by this, we experiment with a general-purpose Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) for text and a special-purpose Dense Table Retriever (DTR) for tables. We show that DPR, without any design for or training on tables, can perform comparably well to the state-of-the-art DTR model, and neither adding DTR-like table-specific embeddings nor perturbing cell orders lead to significant changes. Both results strongly indicate that table retrieval does not necessitate table-specific model design, as well as the potential of directly applying powerful text-generic retrievers to structured tables.",january,True,5.440162362374308,12.923330347459572

However, motivated by CheckList (Ribeiro et al. 2020), we argue for a holistic assessment of DST models since JGA is unable to capture robustness to the inevitable test-time distribution shifts. To this end, we build on recent work on robustness testing in task-oriented dialogue and introduce CheckDST, an instantiation of CheckList for DST that quantifies robustness with test set augmentations and new metrics that measure consistency. Using CheckDST, we are able to extensively compare state-of-the-art DST models, finding that, although span-based classification models achieve slightly better JGA on the original test set than generation models, they are significantly less robust to distribution shift. Secondly, we observe that while stopping training early, e.g. at the first epoch, hurts JGA, the resulting models are significantly more robust to distribution shift. Lastly, guided by the weaknesses exposed by CheckDST, we explore training DST models that simultaneously boost JGA and CheckDST metrics and report preliminary success with PrefineDST, a simple generation model pretrained with non-target datasets to internalize reasoning skills relevant to dialogue state tracking.

5QceorMcHAj,Exploring the Impact of Negative Samples of Contrastive Learning: A Case Study of Sentence Embedding,"Contrastive learning is emerging as a powerful technique for extracting knowledge from unlabeled data. This technique requires a balanced mixture of two ingredients: positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) samples. This is typically achieved by maintaining a queue of negative samples during training. Prior works in the area typically uses a fixed-length negative sample queue, but how the negative sample size affects the model performance remains unclear. The opaque impact of the number of negative samples on performance when employing contrastive learning aroused our in-depth exploration. This paper presents a momentum contrastive learning model with negative sample queue for sentence embedding, namely MoCoSE. We add the prediction layer to the online branch to make the model asymmetric and together with EMA update mechanism of the target branch to prevent model from collapsing. We define a maximum traceable distance metric, through which we learn to what extent the text contrastive learning benefits from the historical information of negative samples. Our experiments find that the best results are obtained when the maximum traceable distance is at a certain range, demonstrating that there is an optimal range of historical information for a negative sample queue. We evaluate the proposed unsupervised MoCoSE on the semantic text similarity (STS) task and obtain an average Spearman's correlation of $77.27\%$.

This paper proposed unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques for topic detection in conversational dialogue corpora and compared them with existing techniques. However, these existing topic detection techniques are widely applied to textual tweets, blogs, documents, textual data on the web. Therefore, we applied these existing techniques to dialogue corpora to detect the topics and compared them with the proposed approach because textual dialogues typically are irregular and short sentences.

The approach also integrates the elbow method for interpretation and validation to select the optimal number of clusters. The paper comprises a comparative analysis of traditional LDA and clustering approaches across both unlabelled (unsupervised) and partially labelled (semi-supervised) switchboard corpus with a proposed novel approach.

In this paper, we focus on low-resource end-to-end event extraction. We propose DEGREE, a model that formulates event extraction as a conditional generation problem. Given a passage and a manually designed prompt, DEGREE learns to summarize the event happening in the passage into a natural sentence that follows a predefined pattern. The final event structure predictions are then extracted from the generated sentence with a deterministic algorithm. DEGREE has the following advantages to learn well with less training data. First, with our design of prompts, DEGREE obtains semantic guidance by leveraging label semantics and thus better captures the argument roles. In addition, the proposed model is capable of using additional weakly-supervised information, such as the description of events. Finally, learning triggers and argument roles in an end-to-end manner encourages the model to better utilize the shared knowledge and dependencies between them.

Although memes are typically intended to elicit humour, they have been increasingly used to spread hatred, trolling, and cyberbullying, as well as to target specific individuals, communities, or society on political, socio-cultural, and psychological grounds. While previous work has focused on detecting harmful, hateful, and offensive memes in general, identifying whom these memes attack (i.e., the `victims') remains a challenging and underexplored area. We attempt to address this problem in this paper. To this end, we create a dataset in which we annotate each meme with its victim(s) such as the name of the targeted person(s), organization(s), and community(ies). We then propose DISARM (Detecting vIctimS targeted by hARmful Memes), a framework that uses named-entity recognition and person identification to detect all entities a meme is referring to, and then, incorporates a novel contextualized multimodal deep neural network to classify whether the meme intends to harm these entities. We perform several systematic experiments on three different test sets, corresponding to entities that are (i) all seen while training, (ii) not seen as a harmful target while training, and (iii) not seen at all while training. The evaluation shows that DISARM significantly outperforms 10 unimodal and multimodal systems.

Recent advances in the development of style representations have increasingly used training objectives from authorship verification (AV): Do two texts have the same author? The assumption underlying the AV training task (same author approximates same writing style) enables self-supervised and, thus, extensive training. However, AV usually does not or only on a coarse-grained level control for topic. The resulting representations might therefore also encode topical information instead of style alone. We introduce a variation of the AV training task that controls for topic using conversation, domain or no topic control as a topic proxy. To evaluate whether trained representations prefer style over topic information, we propose an original variation to the recent STEL framework. We find that representations trained by controlling for conversation are better than representations trained with domain or no topic control at representing style independent from topic.",january,True,-24.41604156905671,-11.094694388120105

The standard approach to distillation trains a student model against two objectives: a task-specific objective (e.g., language modeling) and an imitation objective that encourages the hidden states of the student model to be similar to those of the larger teacher model. In this paper, we show that it is beneficial to augment distillation with a third objective that encourages the student to imitate the \emph{causal} dynamics of the teacher through a distillation interchange intervention training objective (DIITO). DIITO pushes the student model to become a \emph{causal abstraction} of the teacher model -- a faithful model with simpler causal structure. DIITO is fully differentiable, easily implemented, and combines flexibly with other objectives. Compared against standard distillation with the same setting, DIITO results in lower perplexity on the WikiText-103M corpus (masked language modeling) and marked improvements on the GLUE benchmark (natural language understanding), SQuAD (question answering), and CoNLL-2003 (named entity recognition).",january,True,0.8456946399941734,-43.22587214057897

feWkIKJ597Q,Adaptable Adapters,"State-of-the-art pretrained NLP models contain a hundred million to trillion parameters. Adapters provide a parameter-efficient alternative for the full finetuning in which we can only finetune lightweight neural network layers on top of pretrained weights. Adapter layers are initialized randomly. However, existing work uses the same adapter architecture---i.e., the same adapter layer on top of each layer of the pretrained model---for every dataset, regardless of the properties of the dataset or the amount of available training data. In this work, we introduce adaptable adapters that contain (1) learning different activation functions for different layers and different input data, and (2) a learnable switch to select and only use the beneficial adapter layers.  We show that adaptable adapters achieve on-par performances with the standard adapter architecture while using a considerably smaller number of adapter layers. In addition, we show that the selected adapter architecture by adaptable adapters transfers well across different data settings and similar tasks. We propose to use adaptable adapters for designing efficient and effective adapter architectures. The resulting adapters (a) contain about 50% of the learning parameters of the standard adapter and are therefore more efficient at training and inference, and require less storage space, and (b) achieve considerably higher performances in low-resource scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon publication.  ",january,True,2.490020847217633,-11.975415884824317

DGyj3ClCJxd,Controlling the Focus of Pretrained Language Generation Models,"The finetuning of pretrained transformer-based language generation models are typically conducted in an end-to-end manner, where the model learns to attend to relevant parts of the input by itself. However, there does not exist a mechanism to directly control the model's focus. This work aims to develop a control mechanism by which a user can select spans of context as ""highlights'' for the model to focus on, and generate relevant output. To achieve this goal, we augment a pretrained model with trainable ""focus vectors'' that are directly applied to the model's embeddings, while the model itself is kept fixed. These vectors, trained on automatic annotations derived from attribution methods, act as indicators for context importance. We test our approach on two core generation tasks: dialogue response generation and abstractive summarization. We also collect evaluation data where the highlight-generation pairs are annotated by humans. Our experiments show that the trained focus vectors are effective in steering the model to generate outputs that are relevant to user-selected highlights.

However, current autoregressive approaches suffer from high latency. In this paper, we focus on non-autoregressive translation (NAT) for this problem for its efficiency advantage. We identify that current constrained NAT models, which are based on iterative editing, do not handle low-frequency constraints well. To this end, we propose a plug-in algorithm for this line of work, i.e., Aligned Constrained Training (ACT), which alleviates this problem by familiarizing the model with the source-side context of the constraints. Experiments on the general and domain datasets show that our model improves over the backbone constrained NAT model in constraint preservation and translation quality, especially for rare constraints.",january,True,24.032574930707824,-28.242104909326443

jmKioyb4HW5,Exploring Topic-Metadata Relationships with the STM: A Bayesian Approach,"The initial purpose of topic models was to identify latent topical clusters within unstructured text. Meanwhile, the focus of advanced studies  has changed primarily to estimating the relationship between the discovered topical structure and theoretically relevant metadata. Methods used to estimate such relationships must take into account that the topical structure is not directly observed, but instead being estimated itself in an unsupervised fashion. In the Structural Topic Model (STM;Roberts et al., 2016), for instance, multiple repeated linear regressions of sampled topic proportions on metadata covariates are performed. This is done by using a Monte Carlo sampling technique known as the \textit{method of composition}. In this paper, we propose two modifications of this approach: First, we implement a substantial correction to the model by replacing linear regression with the more appropriate Beta regression. Second, we provide a fundamental enhancement of the entire estimation framework by substituting the current blending of frequentist and Bayesian methods with a fully Bayesian approach instead. This allows for a more appropriate quantification of uncertainty. We illustrate our improved methodology by investigating relationships between Twitter posts by German parliamentarians and different metadata covariates related to their electoral districts.",january,True,10.223319816215794,22.982160331056985

Classifying offensive and hate-speech content in online settings is an essential task in many applications that needs to be addressed accordingly. However, online text from online platforms can contain code-switching, a combination of more than one language. The non-availability of labeled code-switched data for a low-resourced code-switching combinations adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we release a synthetic code-switched textual dataset containing around 29k samples for training and a real-world dataset containing around 10k samples for testing for three language combinations en-fr, en-es, and en-de. In this paper, we describe our algorithm for creating synthetic code-switched offensive content data and the process for creating the human-generated data.

In contrast, discriminative models commonly first select aspects from the text, and then classify the aspect's polarity. Previous results showed that generative models outperform discriminative models on several English ABSA datasets. Here, we evaluate and contrast two state-of-the-art discriminative and generative models in several settings: cross-lingual, cross-domain, and cross-lingual and domain, to understand generalizability in settings other than English mono-lingual in-domain.

Finally, one predicts the answer from the retrieved facts and the question, e.g., by prompting a language model as we do here.

To address this challenge, some recent efforts of cross-lingual MRC employ machine translation to transfer knowledge from English to other languages, through either explicit alignment or implicit attention. For effective knowledge transition, it is beneficial to leverage both semantic and syntactic information. However, the existing methods fail to explicitly incorporate syntax information in model learning. Consequently, the models are not robust to errors in alignment and noises in attention. In this work, we propose a novel approach, named GraFusionMRC, which jointly models the cross-lingual alignment information and the mono-lingual syntax information using a graph. We develop a series of algorithms including graph construction, learning, and pre-training. The experiments on two benchmark datasets for cross-lingual MRC show that our approach outperforms all strong baselines, which verifies the effectiveness of syntax information for cross-lingual MRC.

In addition, current approaches for combining models disregard cues such as question-answer compatibility. In this work, we propose to combine expert agents with a novel, flexible, and training-efficient architecture that considers questions, answer predictions, and answer-prediction confidence scores to select the best answer among a list of answer candidates. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments we show that our model i) creates a collaboration between agents that outperforms previous multi-agent and multi-dataset approaches in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, ii) is highly data-efficient to train, and iii) can be adapted to any QA format.

In this paper, we ask whether such rationale models can also provide robustness to adversarial attacks in addition to their interpretable nature. Since these models need to first generate rationales (``rationalizer'') before making predictions (``predictor''), they have the potential to ignore noise or adversarially added text by simply masking it out of the generated rationale. To this end, we systematically generate various types of `AddText' attacks for both token and sentence-level rationalization tasks and perform an extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art rationale models across five different tasks. Our experiments reveal that the rationale models promise to improve robustness over AddText attacks while they struggle in certain scenarios--when the rationalizer is sensitive to position bias or lexical choices of attack text. Further, leveraging human rationale as supervision does not always translate to better performance.

The experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve considerable improvements on both public datasets (i.e., RCV1-v2 and WoS).",january,True,-3.416840004495358,5.283291544020013
Dweo3Oop7lV,LexiCon: Lexically Constrained Review Generation via Robust Insertion,"Existing review generators struggle to generate specific information correctly (e.g., Caesar salad, Snapdragon CPU), which prevents generated reviews from being more informative. In this paper, we propose to introduce lexical constraints into review generation which can be any key phrases to be contained in reviews. Compared to soft constraints (e.g., aspects) used in previous work, lexical constraints easily incorporate specific information which can largely improve the diversity and informativeness of generated reviews. To this end, we present LexiCon, a novel insertion-based review generation framework that can generate personalized reviews containing lexical constraints. Specifically, the proposed method progressively inserts new tokens between existing tokens in a parallel manner until a sequence is completed. Experimental results show that LexiCon outperforms the strongest review generation model by 20% BLEU-2 (coherence) and 68% Distinct-2 (diversity) on average. Human evaluation also shows that LexiCon is more robust to various lexical constraints than the state-of-the-art lexically-constrained model for general purpose.",january,True,-5.782667173690778,32.00163641069061

We show the positive impact of these tasks, particularly named entity recognition, for bridging the gap between languages.

To help bridge this gap, we propose a time-domain articulatory synthesis methodology and demonstrate its efficacy with both electromagnetic articulography (EMA) and synthetic articulatory feature inputs.

However, recent work has argued that the gains produced by RL for NMT are mostly due to promoting tokens that have already received a fairly high probability in pre-training. We hypothesize that the large action space is a main obstacle to RL's effectiveness in MT, and conduct two sets of experiments that lend support to our hypothesis, focusing on low-resource settings. First, we find that reducing the size of the vocabulary improves RL's effectiveness. Second, we find that effectively reducing the dimension of the action space without changing the vocabulary also yields notable improvement as evaluated by BLEU, semantic similarity, and human evaluation. Indeed, by replacing the network's final fully connected layer (that maps the network's internal dimension to the vocabulary dimension), with a layer that generalizes over similar actions, we obtain a substantial improvement in RL performance.",january,True,29.52863667007049,-18.12960819301517

In particular, SemAttack optimizes the generated perturbations constrained on generic semantic spaces, including typo space, knowledge space (e.g., WordNet), contextualized semantic space (e.g., the embedding space of BERT clusterings), or the combination of these spaces. Thus, the generated adversarial texts are more semantically close to the original inputs. Extensive experiments reveal that state-of-the-art (SOTA) large-scale LMs (e.g., DeBERTa-v2) and defense strategies (e.g., FreeLB) are still vulnerable to SemAttack.

We show that effective structured features can be attained even without external knowledge. Three kinds of features based on the input sentences are fully exploited, which are in entity mention level, segment level, and sentence level. All the three are jointly and hierarchically modeled.

Intuitively, such models can more easily output canonical utterances as they are closer to the natural language used for pre-training. More recently, models also pre-trained on code, like OpenAI Codex, have risen in prominence. Since semantic parsing requires translating natural language into code, such models may prove more adept at it.

Although the existing methods that address the degeneration problem based on observations of the phenomenon triggered by the problem improves the performance of the text generation, the training dynamics of token embeddings behind the degeneration problem are still not explored.

GnlD4Dzr1t,Are Pretrained Multilingual Models Equally Fair Across Languages?,"Pretrained multilingual language models can help bridge the digital language divide, enabling high-quality NLP models for lower-resourced languages. Studies of multilingual models have so far focused on performance, consistency, and cross-lingual generalization. However, with their wide-spread application in the wild and downstream societal impact, it is important to put multilingual models under the same scrutiny as monolingual models. This work investigates the group fairness of multilingual models, asking whether these models are equally fair across languages. To this end, we create a new four-way multilingual dataset of parallel cloze test examples (MozArt), equipped with demographic information (balanced with regard to gender and native tongue) about the test participants. We evaluate three multilingual models on MozArt -- mBERT, XLM-R, and mT5 -- and show that across the four target languages, the three models exhibit different levels of group disparity, e.g., exhibiting near-equal risk for Spanish, but high levels of disparity for German.

yBlgRDURgfN,SANCL: Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction with Selective Attention and Natural Contrastive Learning,"With the boom of e-commerce, Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) that identifies the helpfulness score of multimodal product reviews has become a research hotspot. Previous work on this task focuses on attention-based modality fusion, information integration, and relation modeling, which primarily exposes the following drawbacks: 1) the model may fail to capture the really essential information due to its indiscriminate attention formulation;  2) lack appropriate modeling methods that takes full advantage of correlation among provided data.  In this paper, we propose SANCL: Selective Attention and Natural Contrastive Learning for MRHP. SANCL adopts a probe-based strategy to enforce high attention weights on the regions of greater significance.  It also constructs a contrastive learning framework based on natural matching properties in the dataset. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with three categories show that SANCL achieves state-of-the-art baseline performance with lower memory consumption.",january,True,-22.481321762633748,24.41641220304995

Whereas, the knowledge transfer can be constrained by its episodically occurrence, especially when the training sets are small or/and the replay frequency is low (usually 1%).  This paper studies the feasibility of solely using meta learning to address CL problems. In particular, we devise an optimisation-based meta learning framework for CL in accordance with MAML, where query samples are edited for generalisation of learned knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on text classification in a low resource CL setup, where we downsize the training set to its 10%.

t6Vo4bMzb9M,Gated Recursive and Sequential Deep Hierarchical Encoding for Detecting Incongruent News Articles,"With the increase in misinformation across digital platforms, incongruent news  detection is becoming an important research problem. Earlier, researchers have exploited various feature engineering approaches and deep learning models with embedding to capture incongruity between news headlines and the body. Recent studies have also shown the advantages of capturing structural properties of the body using hierarchical encoding. Hierarchical encoding decomposes the body of a news article into smaller segments such as sentences or paragraphs. However, the existing hierarchical methods have not considered two important aspects; (i) deeper hierarchical level, and (ii) importance of different paragraphs in generating document encoding. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a Gated Recursive And Sequential Deep Hierarchical Encoding (GRASHE) method for detecting incongruent news articles by extends hierarchical encoding upto word level and incorporating incongruently weight of each paragraph. Experimental results show that the proposed models outperform the bag-of-word features, sequential and hierarchical encoding-based counterparts. We also perform various ablation analysis to support the proposed models. ",january,True,-0.978040810289867,33.929508388825106

However, existing pre-trained MLMs often output an anisotropic distribution of token representations that occupies a narrow subset of the entire representation space. Such token representations are not ideal, especially for tasks that demand discriminative semantic meanings of distinct tokens.

Building on these prior works, we introduce a novel knowledge-informed encoder-decoder framework to utilize multiple knowledge sources to generate implications of biased text.

While advances reported for English using PLMs are unprecedented, reported advances using PLMs for Hebrew are few and far between. The problem is twofold. First, Hebrew resources for training large language models have not been of the same magnitude as their English counterparts. Second, most bench marks available to evaluate progress in Hebrew NLP require morphological boundaries which are not readily available in the output of PLMs. In this work we aim to remedy both aspects. We present AlephBERT, a large PLM for Modern Hebrew, trained on larger vocabulary and larger dataset than any Hebrew PLM before. More over, we introduce a novel neural architecture that recovers the morphological segments encoded in contextualized embeddings. Based on this new morphological component we offer an evaluation suite consisting of multiple tasks and benchmarks, that cover both word-level and sub-word level analyses.

We show this method at work for degree modifiers (expressions like {\it slightly}, {\it very}, {\it rather}, {\it extremely}) and test the hypothesis that the degree expressed by the modifier (low, medium or high degree) is related to its sensitivity to sentence polarity (whether it shows preference for affirmative or negative sentences or neither).

Although several approaches have been proposed to handle language-vision relation inference (LVRI), they normally rely on the limited information of the posted single sentence and single image. In this paper, to extend the information width of the original input, we introduce a concept of modality translation with two potential directions to generate additional modalities, and propose the auxiliary modality translation framework (AMT) for LVRI. This approach can not only generate the additional image by translating original text, but also the additional text by translating original image. Moreover, towards the potential three or four modalities as input, we employ a unified layer-wise transformer structure to perform multi-modal interactions. Systematic experiments and extensive analysis demonstrate that our approach with auxiliary modality translation significantly outperforms conventional approaches of LVRI and several competitive baselines for other text-image classification tasks.",january,True,22.14450651820438,-2.753930737674831

In practical application scenarios, people want to induce more entity pairs having the same relation from only a few seed entity pairs. Thus, instead of the laborious supervised setting, in this paper, we focus on the minimally-supervised setting where only a couple of seed entity pairs per relation are provided. Although the conventional relation induction methods have made some success, their performance depends heavily on the quality of word embeddings. The great success of Pre-trained Language Models, such as BERT, changes the NLP area a lot, and they are proven to be able to better capture relation knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel method to induce relation with BERT under the minimally-supervised setting. Specifically, we firstly extract proper templates from the corpus by using the mask-prediction task in BERT to build pseudo-sentences as the context of entity pairs. Then we use BERT attention weights to better represent the pseudo-sentences. In addition, We also use the IntegratedGradient of entity pairs to iteratively select better templates further. Finally, with the high-quality pseudo-sentences, we can train a better classifier for relation induction.

However, it is costly for a large-scale model to self-identify tokens that it still struggles to predict.   On the other hand, we observe that a smaller language model can often effectively find what a large model fails to learn. Inspired by this observation, we propose to leverage a compact bi-directional auto-regressive language model to dynamically discover tokens that a large language model has not learned well and guide its training via hardness masking.

In order to address these issues, we evaluate two techniques during fine-tuning, namely, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and L2-distance regularization to assist the multilingual models in retaining their cross-lingual ability after being fine-tuned on a single language. We compare zero-shot cross-lingual performance of mBERT with/without regularization on four different tasks: XNLI, PANX, UDPOS and PAWSX and demonstrate that the model fine-tuned with L2-distance regularization performs better than its vanilla fine-tuned counterpart in zero-shot setting across all the tasks by up to 1.64%. Moreover, by fine-tuning mBERT with different hyperparameter settings on the specified tasks, we demonstrate that L2-distance regularization also makes fine-tuning more robust,  reducing standard deviation of zero-shot results by up to 87%. Based on our experiments, EWC does not provide consistent improvements across languages. Moreover, to test if additional constraint on the encoder parameters would improve the results further, we compared L2-distance regularization with techniques that freeze most of the encoder parameters during fine-tuning, such as bitfit, soft prompting, and adapter-based methods.

Coreference annotation is typically time consuming and expensive, since researchers generally hire expert annotators and train them with an extensive set of guidelines. Crowdsourcing is a promising alternative, but coreference includes complex semantic phenomena difficult to explain to untrained crowdworkers, and the clustering structure is difficult to manipulate in a user interface. To address these challenges, we develop and release ezCoref, an easy-to-use coreference annotation tool, and annotation methodology that facilitates crowdsourced data collection across multiple domains, currently in English. Instead of teaching crowdworkers how to handle non-trivial cases (e.g., near-identity coreferences), ezCoref provides only a minimal set of guidelines sufficient for understanding the basics of the task. To validate this decision, we deploy ezCoref on Mechanical Turk to re-annotate 240 passages from seven existing English coreference datasets across seven domains, achieving an average rate of 2530 tokens per hour, for one annotator. This paper is the first to compare the quality of crowdsourced coreference annotations against those of experts, and to identify where their behavior differs to facilitate future annotation efforts. We show that it is possible to collect coreference annotations of a reasonable quality in a fraction of time it would traditionally require.",january,True,23.320547208603788,18.408130115478833

cw8bp9Juvoj,TEMPLATE: TempRel Classification Model Trained with Embedded Temporal Relation Knowledge,"In recent years, the mainstream Temporal Relation (TempRel) classification methods may not take advantage of the large amount of semantic information contained in golden TempRel labels which is lost by the traditional discrete one-hot labels. So we propose a new approach that can make full use of golden TempRel label information and make the model performance better. Firstly we build a TempRel Classification model which consists of a RoBERTa and a Classifier. Secondly we establish fine-grained templates to automatically generate sentences to enrich golden TempRel label information and build an Enhanced Data-set. Thirdly we use the Enhanced Data-set to train the Knowledge Encoder which has the same structure as the TempRel Classification model, and get embedded knowledge. Finally we Trian the TempRel Classification model with EMbedded temPoral reLATion knowldgE (TEMPLATE) by using our designed Cosine balanced MSE loss function. Extensive experimental results shows that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on TB-Dense and MATRES and outperforms the TempRel Classification model trained with only traditional cross entropy loss function with up to 5.51%F1 on TB-Dense and 2.02%F1 on MATRES.",january,True,9.57370901802925,2.3480566232844478

However, most of the existing unsupervised text style transfer methods suffer from (i) requiring massive amounts of nonparallel data to guide transferring different text styles.

DAML is a domain adaptive meta-learning approach to refine general knowledge in multi-heterogeneous source domains, capable of adapting to new unseen domains with a small amount of data. Moreover, we propose a new unsupervised TST approach Adversarial Transfer Model (ATM), composed of a sequence-to-sequence pre-trained language model and uses adversarial style training for better content preservation and style transfer.

We hypothesize that improvements in QA methodology can also be directly exploited in dialog NLU; however, dialog tasks must be \textit{reformatted} into QA tasks. In particular, we focus on modeling and studying \textit{slot labeling} (SL), a crucial component of NLU for dialog, through the QA optics, aiming to improve both its performance and efficiency, and make it more effective and resilient to working with limited task data. To this end, we make a series of contributions: 1) We demonstrate how QA-tuned PLMs can be applied to the SL task, reaching new state-of-the-art performance, with large gains especially pronounced in such low-data regimes. 2) We propose to leverage contextual information, required to tackle ambiguous values, simply through natural language. 3) Efficiency and compactness of QA-oriented fine-tuning are boosted through the use of lightweight yet effective adapter modules. 4) Trading-off some of the quality of QA datasets for their size, we experiment with larger automatically generated QA datasets for QA-tuning, arriving at even higher performance. Finally, our analysis suggests that our novel QA-based slot labeling models, supported by the PLMs, reach a performance ceiling in high-data regimes, calling for more challenging and more nuanced benchmarks in future work.

Interestingly, we observe that the original transformer with appropriate training techniques can achieve strong results for document translation, even with a length of 2000 words. We evaluate this model and several recent approaches on nine document-level datasets and two sentence-level datasets across six languages.

While showing strong performance on some generation tasks, they don't generalize across all generation tasks. In this work, we show that prompt based conditional text generation can be improved with simple and efficient methods that simulate modeling the discourse structure of human written text. We introduce two key design choices: First, we show that a higher-level discourse structure of human written text can be modelled with hierarchical blocking on prefix parameters. It enables spanning different parts of the input and output text and yields more coherent output generations.  Second, we propose sparse prefix tuning by introducing attention sparsity on the prefix parameters at different layers of the network and learn sparse transformations on the softmax-function, respectively. We find that sparse attention enables the prefix-tuning to better control of the input contents (salient facts) yielding more efficient tuning of the prefix-parameters.  Our experiments show that structured design of prefix parameters can yield more coherent, faithful and relevant generations than baseline prefix-tuning on all generation tasks and perform at par with fine-tuning while being more efficient.",january,True,12.249940579763743,-2.4399902371362288

Gardner et al (2021) argue that due to the compositional nature of language, \emph{all} correlations between labels and individual input features are spurious. This paper analyzes this proposal in the context of a toy example, demonstrating three distinct conditions that can give rise to feature-label correlations through a simple PCFG. Linking the toy example to a structured causal model shows that (1) feature-label correlations can arise even when the label is invariant to interventions on the feature, and (2) feature-label correlations may be absent even when the label \emph{is} sensitive to interventions on the feature. Because input features will be individually correlated with labels except in very rare circumstances, mitigation and stress tests should focus on those correlations that are counterfactually invariant under plausible causal models.

To address this issue, we delve into cross-lingual knowledge distillation and propose a multi-stage distillation framework for constructing a small-size but high-performance cross-lingual model. In our framework, contrastive learning, bottleneck, and parameter recurrent strategies are delicately combined to prevent performance from being compromised during the compression process.

In Chinese NER, making full use of word information is becoming the key to improve model performance. In the previous related work, lexicon was applied to add word information. However, the word vectors generated by that way is static. It means that it cannot accurately describe some polysemous words in a specific context, which will affect the performance of the NER task. This paper presents EiCi to solve this problem. The new method is proposed that, without relying on external pre-trained word vectors, it takes the advantage of the pre-trained language model BERT to extract polysemous word information. In order to further utilize the word information, a sub-module for type recognition is also added to assist the main task of NER.

They can be built using only monolingual corpora without supervision leading to numerous works focusing on unsupervised BWEs. However, most of the current approaches to build unsupervised BWEs do not compare their results with methods based on easy-to-access cross-lingual signals. In this paper, we argue that such signals should always be considered when developing unsupervised BWE methods. The two approaches we find most effective are: 1) using identical words as seed lexicons (which unsupervised approaches incorrectly assume are not available for orthographically distinct language pairs) and 2) combining such lexicons with pairs extracted by matching romanized versions of words with an edit distance threshold. We experiment on thirteen non-Latin languages (and English) and show that such cheap signals work well and that they outperform using more complex unsupervised methods on distant language pairs such as Chinese, Japanese, Kannada, Tamil, and Thai. In addition, we show that our signals are even competitive with the use of high-quality lexicons in supervised approaches.

Segmental Language Models offer a unique approach by conducting unsupervised segmentation as the byproduct of a neural language modeling objective. However, current SLMs are limited in their scalability due to their recurrent architecture. We propose a new type of SLM for use in both unsupervised and lightly supervised segmentation tasks. The MSLM is built on a span-masking transformer architecture, harnessing a masked bidirectional modeling context and attention, as well as adding the potential for model scalability.

ksXwO-c09NX,Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models,"The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we aim to close this gap and propose a structured pruning method---MixedPruning---which matches the distillation counterparts in both latency and accuracy and only incurs 5% of training cost without using unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. This pruning strategy eases optimization and delivers highly competitive and parallelizable subnetworks that were not demonstrated before.

But a dialogue system has to continuously monitor user engagement throughout the dialogue session as well.

We carry out a cross-lingual adjustment of an off-the-shelf mBERT model. We show that this adjustment makes embeddings of semantically similar words from different languages closer to each other, while keeping unrelated words apart. In contrast, fine-tuning of mBERT on English data (for a specific task such as NER) draws embeddings of both related and unrelated words closer to each other. The cross-lingual adjustment of mBERT improves NLI in four languages and NER in two languages. However, in the case of QA performance never improves and sometimes degrades. In that, the increase in the amount of parallel data is most beneficial for NLI, whereas QA performance peaks at roughly 5K parallel sentences and further decreases as the number of parallel sentences increases.",january,True,11.465606050763874,-24.81235689298079

We propose a new task, a \textit{neutral} summary generation from multiple news articles of the varying political spectrum, to facilitate balanced and unbiased news reading. In this paper, we first collect a new dataset, obtain some insights about framing bias through a case study, and propose a new effective metric and models for the task.

IuIP-BWC88W,Few-Shot Authorship Attribution in English Reddit Posts,"Authorship attribution (AA), an area of research seeking to identify the author of a particular text, is typically conducted on a closed set of authors, and often on certain forms of text, such as edited and less colloquial language like that available in news articles. This paper introduces a few-shot learning approach using prototypical networks and a mix of stylometric and pre-trained transformer-related features, as applied to Reddit data.  By employing few-shot learning and applying our efforts to social media text, we are looking to expand beyond the typical AA application--allowing for disjoint author sets and shorter, more colloquial forms of English. Additionally, using subreddit IDs as a proxy for topics, we explore cross-topic analysis and differentiate performance accordingly. In so doing, we test the limits of AA, with the goal of setting a baseline for performance and assessing viability of few-shot learning for this task. Of the exhibited models, those trained with transformer embeddings performed well compared to ones with only stylometric features, and accounting for differing subreddits showed varying performances across models.",january,True,12.549574191937241,11.623863403348965
Ig8xeTpEmHf,Prompt Consistency for Zero-Shot Task Generalization,"One of the most impressive results of recent NLP history is the ability of pre-trained language models to solve new tasks in a zero-shot setting. To achieve this, NLP tasks are framed as natural language prompts, generating a response indicating the predicted output. Nonetheless, the performance in such settings often lags far behind its supervised counterpart, suggesting a large space for potential improvement. In this paper, we explore methods to utilize unlabeled data to improve zero-shot performance. Specifically, we take advantage of the fact that multiple prompts can be used to specify a single task, and propose to regularize prompt consistency, encouraging consistent predictions over this diverse set of prompts. Our method makes it possible to fine-tune the model either with extra unlabeled training data, or directly on test input at inference time in an unsupervised manner. In experiments, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot learner, T0 (Sanh et al. 2021), on 9 out of 11 datasets across 4 NLP tasks by up to 10.6 absolute points in terms of accuracy.

The answers to these questions can be found by collecting many documents on the complex event of interest, extracting relevant information and analyzing it. We present a new approach in which large language models are utilized to generate source documents that allow predicting, given a high-level event definition, the specific events, arguments, and relations between them to construct a schema that describes the complex event in its entirety. Using our model, complete schemas on any topic can be generated on-the-fly without any data collection needed, i.e., in a zero-shot manner. Moreover, we develop efficient methods to extract pertinent information from texts and demonstrate, in a series of experiments, that these schemas are considered to be more complete than human-curated ones in the majority of examined scenarios. Finally, we show that this framework is comparable in performance with previous supervised schema induction methods that rely on collecting real texts while being more general and flexible by avoiding the need to use a predefined ontology.",january,True,1.0136507105974917,30.561820781389223

Previous mainstream VLP approaches typically adopt a two-step strategy relying on external object detectors to encode images in a multi-modal Transformer framework, which suffer from restrictive object concept space, limited image context and inefficient computation. In this paper,  we propose an object-aware end-to-end VLP framework, which directly feeds image grid features from CNNs into the Transformer and learns the multi-modal representations jointly. More importantly, we propose to perform object knowledge distillation to facilitate learning cross-modal alignment at different semantic levels. To achieve that, we design two novel pretext tasks by taking object features and their semantic labels from external detectors as supervision: 1.) Object-guided masked vision modeling task focuses on enforcing object-aware representation learning in the multi-modal Transformer; 2.) Phrase-region alignment task aims to improve cross-modal alignment by utilizing the similarities between noun phrases and object labels in the linguistic space.

However, most systems could only identify a fixed set of intents, without covering a ubiquitous space of real-world semantics. Inducing new dialog intents or excluding out-of-scope (OOS) queries are crucial particularly in complex domains like customer support. We present a simple yet effective intent induction schema via pre-training and contrastive learning. In particular, we first transform pretrained LMs into conversational encoders with in-domain dialogs. Then we conduct context-aware contrastive learning to reveal latent intent semantics via coherence from dialog contexts. By composing a fine-grained intent subspace from in-scope domain data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to induce intents with simple clustering algorithms and detect outliers with probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (pLDA).

In this work, we illuminate this relationship by measuring both quantities together: we debias a model during downstream fine-tuning, which reduces extrinsic bias, and measure the effect on intrinsic bias, which is operationalized as bias extractability with information-theoretic probing. Through experiments on two tasks and multiple bias metrics, we show that our intrinsic bias metric is a better indicator of debiasing than (a contextual adaptation of) the standard WEAT metric, and can also expose cases of superficial debiasing.

In this paper, we pursue a fine-grained investigation into the roles of text in the face of different RL challenges, and reconcile that semantic and non-semantic language representations could be complementary rather than contrasting. Concretely, we propose a simple scheme to extract relevant contextual information into an approximate state hash as extra input for an RNN-based text agent. Such a lightweight plug-in achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art text agents using advanced NLU techniques such as knowledge graph and passage retrieval, suggesting non-NLU methods might suffice to tackle the challenge of partial observability. However, if we remove RNN encoders and use approximate or even ground-truth state hash alone, the model performs miserably, which confirms the importance of semantic function approximation to tackle the challenge of combinatorially large observation and action spaces.

This often creates interference where two or more tasks compete to pull model parameters in different directions. In this work, we study whether sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) improve multi-task learning by specializing some weights for learning shared representations and using the others for learning task-specific information. To this end, we devise task-aware gating functions to route examples from different tasks to specialized experts which share subsets of network weights conditioned on the task. This results in a sparsely activated multi-task model with a large number of parameters, but with the same computational cost as that of a dense model. We demonstrate such sparse networks to improve multi-task learning along three key dimensions: (i) transfer to low-resource tasks from related tasks in the training mixture; (ii) sample-efficient generalization to tasks not seen during training by making use of task-aware routing from seen related tasks; (iii) robustness to the addition of unrelated tasks by avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing tasks.",january,True,1.1012611047021394,-23.775239330178888

Most current methods follow a pipeline strategy, where an off-the-shelf object detector is used to extract visual features which are then fused with language representations for decoder to generate. However, these methods suffer two issues 1) separate vision and language representations fail to capture the interrelations within the two modalities; 2) from the local view, the semantic alignments between images and paragraphs are missing. In order to address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Language Summarization (ViL-Sum) model with a multi-task learning framework. Specifically, we train our model with two auxiliary tasks in a multi-task manner, that are images selection and images reordering. In this way, the interrelations within image and text are well captured. Besides, to further enhance the vision-language representation, we employ a unified transformer-based encoder-decoder structure. The encoder simultaneously takes image and text as input and jointly learns the representations of both. Then the representations are used by the decoder to generate the summary. Experimental results show that ViL-Sum significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. In further analysis, we find that the enhanced representations via multi-task training and joint modeling learn reasonable relations between image and text.",january,True,10.049468460640428,20.42289844708262

lln-R37yXqQ,Teaching BERT to Wait: Balancing Accuracy and Latency for Streaming Disfluency Detection,"In modern interactive speech-based systems, speech is consumed and transcribed incrementally prior to having disfluencies removed. While this post-processing step is crucial for producing clean transcripts and high performance on downstream tasks (e.g. machine translation), most current state-of-the-art NLP models such as the Transformer operate non-incrementally, potentially causing unacceptable delays for the user. In this work we propose a streaming BERT-based sequence tagging model that, combined with a novel training objective, is capable of detecting disfluencies in real-time while balancing accuracy and latency. This is accomplished by training the model to decide whether to immediately output a prediction for the current input or to wait for further context, in essence learning to dynamically size the lookahead window. Our results demonstrate that our model produces comparably accurate predictions and does so sooner than our baselines, with lower flicker. Furthermore, the model attains state-of-the-art latency and stability scores when compared with recent work on incremental disfluency detection.",january,True,20.88525445354635,-17.43915065893429

twgwH7lZj2_,"Do Language Models Have Beliefs? Methods for Detecting, Updating, and Visualizing Model Beliefs","Do language models have beliefs about the world? Dennett (1995) famously argues that even thermostats have beliefs, on the view that a belief is simply an informational state decoupled from any motivational state. In this paper, we discuss approaches to detecting when models have beliefs about the world, updating model beliefs, and visualizing beliefs graphically. Our main contributions include: (1) new metrics for evaluating belief-updating methods focusing on the logical consistency of beliefs, (2) a training objective for Sequential, Local, and Generalizing updates (SLAG) that improves the performance of learned optimizers for updating beliefs, and (3) the introduction of the belief graph, a new form of interface with language models showing the interdependencies between model beliefs.

GKTI_XSGRuJ,UserIdentifier: Implicit User Representations for Simple and Effective Personalized Sentiment Analysis ,"Sentiment Classification models are typically trained to be as generalizable as possible. Invariance to the specific user is considered desirable since models are shared across multitudes of users. However, these models are often unable to produce personalized responses for individual users, based on their data.  Contrary to widely-used personalization techniques based on few-shot and meta-learning, we propose UserIdentifier, a novel scheme for training a single shared model for all users. Our approach produces personalized responses by prepending a fixed, user-specific non-trainable string (called ``user identifier'') to each user's input text. Unlike prior work, this method doesn't need any additional model parameters, any extra rounds of personal few-shot learning or any change made to the vocabulary. We empirically study different types of user identifiers (numeric, alphanumeric, and also randomly generated) and demonstrate that, surprisingly, randomly generated user identifiers outperform the prefix-tuning based state-of-the-art approach by up to 13, on a suite of sentiment analysis datasets.

wFCEfmAFNHY,Efficient Hierarchical Domain Adaptation for Pretrained Language Models,"Generative language models are trained on diverse, general-domain corpora.  However, this limits their applicability to narrower domains, and prior work has shown that continued in-domain training can provide further gains.  In this paper, we introduce a method to scale domain adaptation to many diverse domains using a computationally efficient adapter approach.  Our method is based on the observation that textual domains are partially overlapping, and we represent domains as a hierarchical tree structure where each node in the tree is associated with a set of adapter weights.  When combined with a frozen pretrained language model, this approach enables parameter sharing among related domains, while avoiding negative interference between unrelated ones. Experimental results with GPT-2 and a large fraction of the 100 most represented websites in C4 show across-the-board improvements in-domain.  We additionally provide an inference time algorithm for a held-out domain and show that averaging over multiple paths through the tree enables further gains in generalization, while adding only a marginal cost to inference.",january,True,19.719851698780538,-26.6243855202321

nAErnzRoE2r,End-to-end Speech Translation with Spoken-to-Written Style Conversion,"End-to-end speech translation (ST), which translates speech in source language directly into text in target language by a single model, has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. Compared to the cascade ST, it has the advantages of easier deployment, better efficiency, and less error propagation. Meanwhile, spoken-to-written style conversion has been proved to be able to improve cascaded ST by reducing the gap between the language style of speech transcription and bilingual corpora used for machine translation training. Therefore, it is desirable to integrate the conversion into end-to-end ST. In this paper, we propose a joint task of speech-to-written-style-text conversion and end-to-end ST, as well as an interactive-attention-based multi-decoder model for the joint task to improve end-to-end ST. Experiments on a Japanese-English lecture ST dataset and CoVoST 2 Native Japanese show that our models outperform a strong baseline on Japanese-English ST.

Prompting for Controllable Contextualized Commonsense Inference,"Generating commonsense assertions, given a certain story context, is a tough challenge even for modern language models. One of the reasons for this may be that the model has to ""guess"" what topic or entity in a story to generate an assertion about. Prior work has tackled part of the problem, by providing techniques to align commonsense inferences with stories and training language generation models on these. However, none of the prior work provides means to control the parts of a generated assertion. In this work, we present ""hinting"", a data augmentation technique for improving inference of contextualized commonsense assertions. Hinting is a prefix prompting strategy that uses both hard and soft prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hinting by showcasing its effect on two contextual commonsense inference datasets: ParaCOMET (Gabriel et al., 2021) and GLUCOSE (Mostafazadeh et al., 2020), for both general and context-specific inference.",january,True,-5.590920776144655,3.8678051813190497

In view of that, recently, a middle-ground approach has emerged: to do automatic fact-checking by verifying whether the input claim has been previously fact-checked by professional fact-checkers, and to return back an article that explains the verdict on the claim. This is a sensible approach as people trust manual fact-checking, and as many claims are repeated multiple times online. Yet, a major issue when building such kinds of systems is the small number of known input--verified claim pairs available for training. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by making use of crowd fact-checking, i.e., mining claims in social media for which users have responded with a link to a fact-checking article. In particular, we mine a large-scale collection of 330,000 tweets paired with a corresponding fact-checking article. We further propose a new model to learn from this noisy data based on modified self-adaptive training, in a distant supervision scenario.

On HotpotQA we systematically investigate reducing the size of the KB index by means of dimensionality (sparse random projections, PCA, autoencoders) and numerical precision reduction.  Our results show that PCA is an easy solution that requires very little data and is only slightly worse than autoencoders, which are less stable. All methods are sensitive to pre- and post-processing and data should always be centered and normalized both before and after dimension reduction. Finally, we show that it is possible to combine PCA with using 1bit per dimension.

This view allows us to extend techniques from learning-based control, such as task relabeling, to derive a simple and effective method to finetune language models in a goal-aware way, leading to significantly improved task performance.

Their performance, however, reveals there is room for improvement as they mishandle delicate cross-lingual instances. We employ Adversarial Language Adaptation to train a Language Discriminator to discern between the source and target languages using unlabeled data. The discriminator is trained in an adversarial manner so that the encoder learns to produce refined, language-invariant representations that lead to improved performance. More importantly, we optimize the adversarial training by only presenting the discriminator with the most informative samples. We base our intuition about what makes a sample informative on two disparate metrics: sample similarity and event presence.

With the growth of the number of utterances, this discrepancy becomes more serious in the multi-turn settings.

These problems can be improved by learning representations that focus on similarities in the same class and variance in different classes when making predictions. In this paper, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier in pre-trained model fine-tuning. For this KNN classifier, we introduce a supervised momentum contrastive learning framework to learn the clustered representations of the supervised downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on text classification tasks and robustness tests show that by incorporating KNNs with the traditional fine-tuning process, we can obtain significant improvements on the clean accuracy in both rich-source and few-shot settings and can improve the robustness against adversarial attacks. \footnote{all codes will be available at https://github.com//}",january,True,7.851833486355289,-16.339732345839913

h0tPIek3cK,Seq-GAN-BERT：Sequence Generative Adversarial Learning for  Low-resource Name Entity Recognition,"Named entity recognition (NER), as an important basic task of natural language processing, has been widely studied. In the case of relatively sufficient labeled data, traditional NER methods have achieved remarkable results. However, due to the lack of labeled data in many fields and the difficulty of manual annotation, the task of low-resource NER has become a research hotspot. To effectively improve the recognition accuracy of low-resource NER, this paper proposes the semi-supervised learning model Seq-GAN-BERT，which integrates the adversarial generative network based on the pre-trained language model BERT, and uses the domain unlabeled corpus to train the adversarial generative network to learn the important general semantic information of the data. The proposed Seq-GAN-BERT method can further optimize BERT-based supervised training and improve the ability of entity recognition. The experimental results show that our model greatly reduces the dependence on labeled samples and effectively improves the performance of low-resource NER task.",january,True,-29.99453243297427,-7.063661187739294

Hence, it is crucial to develop effective generative models to produce high-quality AEs. Developing such models has been much slower in natural language processing (NLP).

L99I9HrEtEm,Generating a Temporally Coherent Visual Story by Multimodal Recurrent Transformers,"Story visualization is a challenging text-to-image generation task for the difficulty of rendering visual details from abstract text descriptions. Besides the difficulty of image generation, the generator also needs to conform to the narrative of a multi-sentence story input. While prior arts in this domain have focused on improving semantic relevance between generated images and input text, controlling the generated images to be temporally consistent still remains a challenge. Moreover, existing generators are trained on single text-image pairs and fail to consider the variations of natural language captions that can describe a given image, causing poor model generalization. To address such problems, we leverage a cyclic training methodology involving pseudo-text descriptions as an intermediate step that decouples the image’s visual appearance from the variations of natural language descriptions. Additionally, to generate a semantically coherent image sequence, we consider an explicit memory controller which can augment the temporal coherence of images in the multi-modal autoregressive transformer. To sum up all components, we call it Cyclic Story visualization by MultimodAl Recurrent Transformers or C-SMART for short.

Such sentences (textual mentions of entity-pairs) are represented as Lexicalised Dependency Paths (LDPs) between two entities. However, it is not possible to represent relations between entities that do not co-occur in a single sentence using LDPs. In this paper, we propose and evaluate several methods to address this problem, where we \emph{borrow} LDPs from the entity pairs that co-occur in sentences in the corpus (i.e. \emph{with mentions} entity pairs) to represent entity pairs that do \emph{not} co-occur in any sentence in the corpus (i.e. \emph{without mention} entity pairs). We propose a supervised borrowing method, \emph{SuperBorrow}, that learns to score the suitability of an LDP to represent a without-mentions entity pair using pre-trained entity embeddings and contextualised LDP representations. Experimental results show that SuperBorrow improves the link prediction performance of multiple widely-used prior KGE methods such as TransE, DistMult, ComplEx and RotatE.

Therefore, dangling-aware entity alignment is more realistic than the conventional entity alignment where prior studies simply ignore dangling entities. We propose a framework using mixed high-order proximities on dangling-aware entity alignment. Our framework utilizes both the local high-order proximity in a nearest neighbor subgraph and the global high-order proximity in an embedding space for both dangling detection and entity alignment. Extensive experiments with two evaluation settings shows that our method more precisely detects dangling entities, and better aligns matchable entities.

However, to date it is unclear whether the performance differences are due to better representations, better classifiers or both. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the features learnt by BERT overlap with commonly used manual features. To answer these, we exchange features between BERT-based and SVM classifiers, and show that, an SVM fed with BERT representations performs at the level of the best BERT classifiers, and BERT learning and using hand-crafted features performs at the level of traditional classifiers using hand-crafted features. Our experiments indicate that our hand-crafted feature set does not provide any additional information that BERT has not learnt already, and is likely to be a subset of features automatically learnt by BERT.

Then we present a positive-emotion-guided dialog generation model with a novel loss function design.

Finally, we establish benchmark results on PosEmoDial, and we will release this dataset and related source code to facilitate future studies. ",january,True,-21.7911219811825,17.586635828363736

In this work, we propose a topic modeling-based classification model that can perform higher with even a small number of labels.

Dye-_x--S_y,PROMPT WAYWARDNESS: The Curious Case of Discretized Interpretation of Continuous Prompts,"Fine-tuning continuous prompts for target tasks has recently emerged as a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning. Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a ""wayward"" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",january,True,-3.797461084182348,-26.664941709378912

In comparison to the numerous prior work evaluating the social biases in pretrained word embeddings, the biases in sense embeddings have been relatively under studied. In this paper, we create a benchmark dataset for evaluating the social biases in sense embeddings and propose novel sense-specific bias evaluation measures. We conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple static and contextualised sense embeddings for various types of social biases using the proposed measures. Our experimental results show that even in cases where no biases are found at word-level, there still exist worrying levels of social biases at sense-level, which are often ignored by the word-level bias evaluation measures.",january,True,13.214219482138697,-11.401614759053375

Despite the great success in sentence-level event extraction, events are more naturally presented in the form of documents, with event arguments scattered in multiple sentences. However, a major barrier to promote document-level event extraction has been the lack of large-scale and practical training and evaluation datasets. In this paper, we present DocEE, a new document-level event extraction dataset including 20,000+ events, 100,000+ arguments. We highlight three features: large-scale manual annotations, fine-grained argument types and application-oriented settings.

Recently, another approach has emerged: checking whether the input claim has previously been fact-checked, which can be done automatically, and thus fast, while also offering credibility and explainability, thanks to the human fact-checking and explanations in the associated fact-checking article. Here we focus on claims made in a political debate, where context really matters. We study the impact of modeling the context of the claim: both on the source side, i.e., in the debate, as well as on the target side, i.e., in the fact-checking explanation document. We do this by modeling the local context, the global context, as well as by means of co-reference resolution, and multi-hop reasoning over the sentences of the document describing the fact-checked claim. The experimental results show that each of these represents a valuable information source, but that modeling the source-side context is more important and can yield 10+points of absolute improvement over a state-of-the-art model.

HtE8HqiU1iX,MetaICL: Learning to Learn In Context,"We introduce MetaICL (Meta-training for In-Context Learning), a new meta-training framework for few-shot learning where a pretrained language model is tuned to do in-context learning on a large set of training tasks. This meta-training enables the model to more effectively learn a new task in context at test time, by simply conditioning on a few training examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates. We experiment on a large, diverse collection of tasks consisting of 142 NLP datasets including classification, question answering, natural language inference, paraphrase detection and more, across seven different meta-training/target splits. MetaICL outperforms a range of baselines including in-context learning without meta-training and multi-task learning followed by zero-shot transfer. We find that the gains are particularly significant for target tasks that have domain shifts from the meta-training tasks, and that using a diverse set of the meta-training tasks is key to improvements. We also show that MetaICL approaches (and sometimes beats) the performance of models fully finetuned on the target task training data, and outperforms much bigger models with nearly 8x parameters.",january,True,32.340726823413505,-5.304916939692158

dFW4mQrfWs,That is a good looking car !: Visual Aspect based Sentiment Controlled Personalized Response Generation,"In a conversational system, generating utterances that communicate consistent and relevant preferences is vital for more personalized conversations. In this paper, we propose a task of generating utterances grounded on some assigned aspect-preferences-profile. These aspect-preference profiles consist of a list of aspect-sentiment tuples, denoting the preference of the speaker for some aspect in the form of sentiment (""positive"" or ""negative""). Since no prior dataset containing such profiles is available, we enhance Image-Chat data by assigning these profiles to each user in a conversation. The conversations in this dataset are based on an image, therefore the aspects are present in images as well as dialogue history. We build a BERT and ResNet-based encoder-decoder model with a memory network to store preference-profile. Through our experiments, we show that our model can generate responses that convey the sentiment of relevant aspects in accordance with the assigned profile. Both automatic and manual evaluations show the effectiveness of our model and dataset. Our proposed system when using these profiles achieves a BLEU-1 score of 15.93 on this new task, which is an improvement of 2.92 points from the baseline experiment that does not use aspect-preference profiles.",january,True,-16.887815896031434,14.993293910007544

zFPnAh5OuQ-,The Change that Matters in Discourse Parsing: Estimating the Impact of Domain Shift on Parser Error,"Discourse analysis allows us to attain high-level inferences of a text document beyond the sentence-level. However, currently the performance of discourse models is very low on texts outside of the training distribution's coverage. There is need for a measure that can inform us to what extent our model generalizes from the training to the test sample when these samples may be drawn from distinct distributions. While this can be estimated via distribution shift, we argue that this does not directly correlate with change in the observed error of a classifier (i.e. error-gap). Thus, we propose to use a statistic from the theoretical domain adaptation literature which can be directly tied to error-gap. We study the bias of this statistic as an estimator of error-gap both theoretically and through a large-scale empirical study of over 2400 experiments on 6 discourse datasets from domains including, but not limited to: news, biomedical texts, TED talks, Reddit posts, and fiction. Our results not only motivate our proposal and help us to understand its limitations, but also provide insight on the properties of discourse models and datasets which improve performance in domain adaptation. For instance, we find that non-news datasets are slightly easier to transfer to than news datasets when the training and test sets are very different.

However, human perception of difficulty may not always correlate well with machine interpretation leading to poor performance and exhaustive search is computationally expensive. Addressing these concerns, we propose two classes of techniques to arrange training instances into a learning curriculum based on difficulty scores computed via model-based approaches. The two classes i.e Dataset-level and Instance-level differ in the granularity of arrangement. We conduct comprehensive experiments with $12$ datasets and show that instance-level and dataset-level techniques lead to an average performance improvement of $4.17\%$ and $3.15\%$ over their respective baseline methods.

Previous research on MRLs claimed that standardly trained contextualized embeddings based on word-pieces do not sufficiently capture the internal structure of words with hugely ambiguous homographs. Taking Hebrew as a case study, we investigate the extent to which Hebrew homographs can be disambiguated using contextualized embeddings. We evaluate all existing models for contextualized Hebrew embeddings on 75 Hebrew homograph challenge sets. Our empirical results demonstrate that contemporary Hebrew contextualized embeddings outperform non-contextualized embeddings; they are most effective for disambiguation of segmentation and morphological features, less so regarding pure sense disambiguation.  We show that these embeddings are more effective when the number of word-piece splits is limited, and they are more effective for 2-way and 3-way ambiguities than for 4-way ambiguity. We show that the embeddings are equally effective for homographs of both balanced and skewed distributions. Finally, we show that these embeddings are as effective for homograph disambiguation with extensive supervised training as with a few-shot setup. ",january,True,4.583076884516679,-25.488258203475542

Frequently, these conditions are described in radiology reports which can be retrieved using information retrieval (IR) methods. The latest of these techniques utilize neural IR models such as BERT trained on clinical text. However, these methods still lack semantic understanding of the underlying clinical conditions as well as ruled out findings, resulting in poor precision during retrieval. In this paper we combine clinical finding detection with supervised query match learning. Specifically, we use lexicon-driven concept detection to detect relevant findings in sentences. These findings are used as queries to train a Sentence-BERT (SBERT) model using triplet loss on matched and unmatched query-sentence pairs. We show that the proposed supervised training task remarkably improves the retrieval performance of SBERT.

During learning, RGL constructs a relation graph based on the label consistency between samples in the same batch, and learns to solve the resultant node classification and link prediction problems of the relation graphs. In this way, RGL fully exploits the limited supervised information, which can boost the tuning effectiveness. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks show that RGL consistently improve the performance of prompt-based tuning strategies. ",january,True,-7.188920715108632,-20.35097522224475

We develop AcTune, a new framework that improves the label efficiency of active PLM fine-tuning by unleashing the power of unlabeled data via self-training. AcTune switches between data annotation and model self-training based on uncertainty: the unlabeled samples of high-uncertainty are selected for annotation, while the ones from low-uncertainty regions are used for model self-training. Additionally, we design (1) a region-aware sampling strategy to avoid redundant samples when querying annotations and (2) a momentum-based memory bank to dynamically aggregate the model's pseudo labels to suppress label noise in self-training. Experiments on 6 text classification datasets show that AcTune outperforms the strongest active learning and self-training baselines and improves the label efficiency of PLM fine-tuning by $56.2\%$ on average.",january,True,-6.462371482461102,-22.628290489343232

We present that pre-trained Transformers can be further regularized by employing mutual information to alleviate such issues in neural machine translation (NMT).

Specifically, we employ mutual information to measure the nonlinear mutual dependencies of token-token interactions during attention calculation. Moreover, we resort to InfoNCE for mutual information estimation to avoid the intractable problem. By maximizing the mutual information among tokens, we capture more knowledge concerning token-token interactions from the training corpus to reduce the model uncertainty. Experimental results on WMT'14 En$\rightarrow$De and WMT'14 En$\rightarrow$Fr demonstrate the consistent effectiveness and evident improvements of our model over the strong baselines.

Usually systems focus on selecting the correct answer to a question given a contextual paragraph. However, for many applications of multiple-choice MRC systems there are two additional considerations. For multiple-choice exams there is often a negative marking scheme; there is a penalty for an incorrect answer. This means that the system is required to have an idea of the uncertainty in the predicted answer. The second consideration is that many multiple-choice questions have the option of none of the above (NOA) indicating that none of the answers is applicable, rather than there always being the correct answer in the list of choices. This paper investigates both of these issues by making use of predictive uncertainty. It is shown that uncertainty does allow questions that the system is not confident about to be detected. Additionally we show that uncertainty outperforms a system explicitly built with an NOA option for the ReClor corpus.",january,True,-14.746821439373337,-8.038897692333844

Inspired by the recent progress in large language models, we propose $\textit{in-context tuning}$ (ICT), which recasts task adaptation and prediction as a simple sequence prediction problem: to form the input sequence, we concatenate the task instruction, labeled in-context examples, and the target input to predict; to meta-train the model to learn from in-context examples, we fine-tune a pre-trained language model (LM) to predict the target label given the input sequence on a collection of tasks.  We benchmark our method on two collections of text classification tasks: LAMA and BinaryClfs. Compared to MAML which adapts the model through gradient descent, our method leverages the inductive bias of pre-trained LMs to perform pattern matching, and outperforms MAML by an absolute $6\%$ average AUC-ROC score on BinaryClfs, gaining more advantage with increasing model size. Compared to non-fine-tuned in-context learning (i.e. prompting a raw LM), in-context tuning meta-trains the model to learn from in-context examples. On BinaryClfs, ICT improves the average AUC-ROC score by an absolute $10\%$, and reduces the variance due to example ordering by 6x and example choices by 2x.

In this approach, a source-to-target model is coupled with a target-to-source model and trained in parallel. While the target-to-source model generates noisy sources, the source-to-target model is trained to reconstruct the targets and vice versa. Recent developments of multilingual pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models for programming languages have been very effective for a broad spectrum of downstream software engineering tasks. Therefore, it is compelling to train them to build programming language translation systems via back-translation. However, these models cannot be further trained via back-translation since they learn to output sequences in the same language as the inputs during pre-training. As an alternative, we suggest performing back-translation via code summarization and generation. In code summarization, a model learns to generate a natural language (NL) summary given a piece of code, and in code generation, the model learns to do the opposite. Therefore, target-to-source generation in back-translation can be viewed as target-to-NL-to-source generation. We take advantage of labeled data for the code summarization task.

j_ydETLwbsv,Looking Into the Black Box - How Are Idioms Processed in BERT?,"Idioms such as ``call it a day'' and ``piece of cake'' are ubiquitous in natural language. How are idioms processed by language models such as BERT? This study investigates this question with three experiments: (1) an analysis of embedding similarities of idiomatic sentences and their literal spelled-out counterparts, (2) an analysis of word embeddings when the word appears in an idiomatic versus literal context, and (3) an attention analysis of words when they appear in an idiomatic versus literal context. Each of these three experiments analyse results across all layers of BERT. Experiment 1 shows that the cosine similarity of the embeddings of an idiom sentence and its spelled-out counterpart increases the deeper the layer. However, when compared to random controls, layer 8 is where the spelled-out counterpart is ranked highest in embedding similarity. Experiment 2 shows that the embedding of single words in idiomatic versus literal contexts diverge and become the most different in layer 8 also. Experiment 3 shows that other sentence tokens pay less attention to a word inside an idiom compared to the same word in a literal sentence. Overall, the study suggests that BERT ``understands'' idiomatic expressions, and that it processes them more akin to a syntactic phenomenon than purely a semantic one.

5kVxr1D_0Xq,GraphDiffs: Graph Modeling with Differential Sequence for Document-Grounded Conversation,"Knowledge grounded dialogue systems need to incorporate natural transitions between knowledge for dialogue to flow smoothly. Current systems not only lack good structured representations for knowledge that span multiple documents, but also effective algorithms that utilize such resources. We design a Co-Referential Multi-Document Graph(CoRM-DoG) that seamlessly captures inter-document correlations and intra-document co-referential knowledge relations. To best linearise this static graph into sequential dialogues, we contribute a Graph Modeling with Differential Sequence (GraphDiffs) method for knowledge transitions in dialogue. GraphDiffs performs knowledge selection by natively accounting for contextual graph structure and introducing differential sequence learning to effectively learn multi-turn knowledge transitions. Our analysis shows that GraphDiffs based on CoRM-DoG significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 9.5\% and 7.4% on two public benchmarks, WoW and Holle-E, where the modeling of co-reference and differential sequence are critical factors for its success.",january,True,-10.348578825295672,13.530118245510888

igVquoXGiLo,Improving Conversational Recommendation Systems’ Quality with Context-Aware Item Meta-Information,"A key challenge of Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) is to integrate the recommendation function and the dialog generation function smoothly. Previous works employ graph  neural  networks  with  external  knowledge graphs (KG) to model individual recommendation items and integrate KGs with language models through attention mechanism for response generation.   Although previous approaches prove effective, there is still room for improvement. For example, KG-based approaches only rely on entity relations and bag-of-words to recommend items and neglect the information in the conversational context. We propose to improve the usage of dialog context for  both  recommendation  and  response  generation using an encoding architecture along with the self-attention mechanism of transformers.   In this paper,  we propose a simple yet effective architecture comprising a pre-trained language model (PLM) and an item metadata encoder to integrate the recommendation and the dialog generation better. The proposed item encoder learns to map item metadata to embeddings reflecting the rich information of the item, which can be matched with dialog context. The  PLM  then  consumes  the  context-aware item embeddings and dialog context to generate high-quality recommendations and responses. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset ReDial show that our model obtains state-of-the-art results on both recommendation and response generation tasks.",january,True,-13.594482927439147,20.270551178138543

However, most knowledge distillation methods focus on extracting the ``knowledge'' from a teacher network to guide the training of a student network, ignoring the ``requirements'' of the student.  In this paper, we introduce Tree Knowledge Distillation for Transformer-based teacher and student models, which allows student to actively extract its ``requirements'' via a tree of tokens. In specific, we first choose the |[CLS]| token at the output layer of Transformer in student as the root of the tree.  We choose tokens with the highest values in the row for |[CLS]| of the attention feature map at the second last layer as the children of the root.  Then we choose children of these nodes in their corresponding rows of the attention feature map at the next layer, respectively.  Later, we connect layers of Transformer in student to corresponding layers in teacher by skipping every $t$ layers. At last, we improve the loss function by adding the summed mean squared errors between the embeddings of the tokens in the tree. The experiments show that tree knowledge distillation achieves competitive performance for compressing BERT among other knowledge distillation methods in GLUE benchmark.

We fine-tune our model on the ReDIAL conversational movie recommendation dataset, and create additional training tasks derived from MovieLens (such as the prediction of movie attributes and related movies based on an input movie), in a multitask learning setting.

However, literature in NLP typically labels a whole language with a strict type of morphology, e.g. fusional or agglutinative.  In this work, we propose to reduce the theoretical rigidity of such claims, by quantifying the morphological typology at the word and segment level.  We consider Payne (2017)'s approach to classify morphology using two indices: synthesis (from 1 for analytic to 3 or more for polysynthetic) and fusion (from 0 for agglutinative to 1 for fusional). For computing synthesis, we test unsupervised and supervised morphological segmentation methods for English, German and Turkish, whereas for fusion, we propose a semi-automatic method using Spanish as a case study. Then, we analyse the relationship between machine translation quality and the degree of synthesis and fusion at word (nouns and verbs for English-Turkish, and verbs in English-Spanish) and segment level (previous language pairs plus English-German in both directions). We complement the word-level analysis with human evaluation, and overall, we observe a consistent impact of both indexes on machine translation quality.",january,True,4.9384125141156785,-26.75765612653749

We further leverage a reinforcement learning technique to reward generating high-quality questions and to improve the answer extraction model's performance.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the syntactic multi-modality problem. Specifically, we decompose it into short- and long-range syntactic multi-modalities and evaluate several recent NAT algorithms with advanced loss functions on both carefully designed synthesized datasets and real datasets. We find that the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and the Order-Agnostic Cross Entropy (OAXE) loss can better handle short- and long-range syntactic multi-modalities respectively.

Such training objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence is not perfect, e.g., when the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence supervision is available. To address the challenge, we propose a novel Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a target $n$-gram with all $n$-grams in the generated sequence. EISL is designed to be robust to various noises and edits in the target sequences. Moreover, the EISL computation is essentially an approximate convolution operation with target $n$-grams as kernels, which is easy to implement and efficient to compute with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we conduct experiments on a wide range of tasks, including machine translation with noisy target sequences, unsupervised text style transfer with only weak training signals, and non-autoregressive generation with non-predefined generation order.

Learning to generate such canonical utterance requires significant amount of data to reach high performance. Fine-tuning with only few-shot samples, the LMs can easily forget pretrained knowledge, overfit spurious biases, and suffer from compositionally out-of-distribution generalization errors.  To tackle these issues, we propose a novel few-shot semantic parsing method -- SEQZERO. SEQZERO decomposes the problem into a sequence of sub-problems, which corresponds to the sub-clauses of the formal language.  Based on the decomposition, the LMs only need to generate short answers using prompts for predicting sub-clauses. Thus, SEQZERO avoids generating a long canonical utterance at once.  Moreover, SEQZERO employs not only a few-shot model but also a zero-shot model to alleviate the overfitting. In particular, SEQZERO brings out the merits from both models via ensemble equipped with our proposed constrained rescaling.

Z1LmYdQluQz,Identifying and Measuring Token-Level Sentiment Bias in Pre-trained Language Models with Prompts,"Due to the superior performance, large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been widely adopted in many aspects of human society. However, we still lack effective tools to understand the potential bias embedded in the black-box models. Recent advances in prompt tuning show the possibility to explore the internal mechanism of the PLMs. In this work, we propose two token-level sentiment tests: Sentiment Association Test (SAT) and Sentiment Shift Test (SST) which utilize the prompt as a probe to detect the latent bias in the PLMs. Our experiments on the collection of sentiment datasets show that both SAT and SST can identify sentiment bias in PLMs and SST is able to quantify the bias. The results also prove that fine-tuning can augment existing bias in PLMs. ",january,True,-6.79739708568977,-18.330015929044865

Especially in document-grounded dialog systems, human experts need to carefully read the unstructured documents to answer the users' questions. As a result, existing document-grounded dialog datasets are relatively small-scale and obstruct the effective training of dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose an automatic data augmentation technique grounded on documents through a generative dialogue model. The dialogue model consists of a user bot and agent bot that can synthesize diverse dialogues given an input document, which are then used to train a downstream model. When supplementing the original dataset, our method achieves significant improvement over traditional data augmentation methods.

oaA1xSdZD6h,AutoAttention: Automatic Attention Head Selection Through Differentiable Pruning,"Multi-head attention is considered as a driving force and key component behind the state-of-art transformer models. However, recent research reveals that there are many redundant heads with duplicated patterns in each layer. In this work, we propose an automatic pruning strategy using differentiable binary gates to remove redundant heads. We relax the binary head pruning problem into a differentiable optimization by employing Straight Through Estimators (STEs), in which the model weights and head-sparse model structure can be jointly learned through back-propagation. In this way, attention heads can be pruned efficiently and effectively. Experimental results on the General Language Understanding Evaluation  (GLUE)  benchmark are provided using BERT model. We could reduce more than 57% heads on average with zero or minor accuracy drop on all nine tasks and even achieve better results than state-of-the-arts (e.g., Random, HISP, $L0$ Norm, SMP, etc). Furthermore, our proposed method can prune more than 79% heads with only 0.82% accuracy degradation on average. We further illustrate the pruning procedure and parameters change through the head attention visualization and show how the trainable gate parameters determine the head mask and the final attention map.",january,True,23.029594004507825,-8.67537809453672

Critically, we observe that robustness can be achieved without compromising on the original performance.

However, for tasks that require a large amount of knowledge, non-parametric memory allows models to grow dramatically with a sub-linear increase in computational cost and GPU memory requirements.  Recent models such as RAG and REALM have introduced retrieval into conditional generation.  These models incorporate neural initial retrieval from a corpus of passages.  We build on this line of research, proposing Re2G, which combines both neural initial retrieval and reranking into a BART-based sequence-to-sequence generation.  Our reranking approach also permits merging retrieval results from sources with incomparable scores, enabling an ensemble of BM25 and neural initial retrieval.  To train our system end-to-end, we introduce a novel variation of knowledge distillation to train the initial retrieval, reranker and generation using only ground truth on the target sequence output.

Furthermore, we investigate data augmentation via generation for question answering in three different low-resource settings relevant in practice and how this can be improved: 1) No labels for the target domain, 2) static, labelled data for the target domain and 3) an Active Learning approach with labels for the target domain provided by an expert. In all settings we assume sufficient amount of labelled data from the source domain is available. We perform extensive experiments in each of the above conditions.

UVWsPH3vtn2,Towards a Fast Response Selection: Selecting the Optimal Dialogue Response Once for All,"Response selector, as an essential component of dialogue systems, aims to pick out an optimal response in a candidate pool to continue the dialogue. The current state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on an encoding paradigm called Cross-Encoder, which separately encodes each context-response pair and ranks the responses according to their fitness scores. However, such a paradigm is both inefficient and ineffective. Specifically, it has to repeatedly encode the same context for each response, which results in heavy inference cost. Also, without considering the relationship among the candidates, it is difficult to tell which one is the best candidate purely based on the fitness score of each candidate. To address this problem, we propose a new model called Panoramic-Encoder, which accepts all candidates and the context as inputs at once and allows them to interact with each other through a specially designed attention mechanism. Our method also allows us to naturally integrate some of the effective training techniques, such as the in-batch negative training.

Furthermore, we propose a novel knowledge infusion (KI) method to get a sentiment-aware knowledge representation on top of our multitasking model. This sentiment-aware knowledge representation is obtained from a pre-trained parent model and subsequently, this representation is used via a novel Gating Mechanism to train our downstream multitasking model. For training and evaluation purposes, we created a large-scale dataset consisting of 7,416 sample Hindi memes as there was no readily available dataset for building such multimodal systems. We collect the Hindi memes from various domains, such as politics, religious, racist, and sexist, and manually annotate each instance with three sarcasm categories, i.e., (i) Not Sarcastic, ii) Mildly Sarcastic or iii) Highly Sarcastic ) and 13 fine-grained emotion classes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed work through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our proposed system achieves a 64.48% macro F1-score, outperforming all the baseline models. Finally, we note that our proposed system is model agnostic and can be used with any downstream model in practice.

tyamee9W92,Fast and Accurate Span-based Semantic Role Labeling as Graph Parsing,"Currently, BIO-based and Tuple-based approaches perform quite well on the span-based semantic role labeling (SRL) task.  However, the BIO-based approach usually needs to encode a sentence once for each predicate when predicting its arguments, and the Tuple-based approach has to deal with a huge search space of $O(n^3)$, greatly reducing the training and inference efficiency.  Moreover, both BIO-based and Tuple-based approaches usually consider only local structural information when making predictions. This paper proposes to cast end-to-end span-based SRL as a graph parsing task. Based on a novel graph representation schema, we present a fast and accurate SRL parser on the shoulder of recent works on high-order semantic dependency graph parsing (SDGP).  Moreover, we propose a constrained Viterbi procedure to ensure the legality of the output graph. Experiments on CoNLL05, CoNLL12, and Chinese Proposition Bank 1.0 (CPB1.0) datasets show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art results and can parse over 600 sentences per second.",january,True,-19.809114250942418,-4.8225913368778945

With more than 20,000,000 suicide attempts each year, the early detection of suicidal intent has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Traditional mental health screening methods are time-consuming, costly, and often inaccessible to disadvantaged populations; online detection of suicidal intent using machine learning offers a viable alternative. Here we present Robin, the largest non-keyword generated suicidal corpus to date, consisting of over 1.1 million online forum postings. In addition to its unprecedented size, Robin is specially constructed to include various categories of suicidal text, such as suicide bereavement and flippant references, better enabling models trained on Robin to learn the subtle nuances of text expressing suicidal ideation. Experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance for the classification of suicidal text, both with traditional methods like logistic regression (F1=0.85), as well as with large scale pre-trained language models like BERT (F1=0.92).

GNfsr9EXKMH,Measuring and Improving Compositional Generalization in Text-to-SQL via Component Alignment,"In text-to-SQL tasks --- as in much of NLP --- compositional generalization is a major challenge: neural networks struggle with compositional generalization where training and test distributions differ. However, most recent attempts to improve this are based on word-level synthetic data or specific dataset splits to generate compositional biases. In this work, we propose a clause-level compositional example generation method. We first split the sentences in the Spider text-to-SQL dataset into sub-sentences, annotating each sub-sentence with its corresponding SQL clause, resulting in a new dataset Spider-SS. We then construct a further dataset, Spider-CG, by composing Spider-SS sub-sentences in different combinations, to test the ability of models to generalize compositionally. Experiments show that existing models suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on Spider-CG, even though every sub-sentence is seen during training. To deal with this problem, we modify a number of state-of-the-art models to train on the segmented data of Spider-SS, and we show that this method improves the generalization performance.",january,True,6.893910578317968,7.431133919557751

The scale of Wikidata can open up many new real-world applications, but its massive number of entities also makes EL challenging. To effectively narrow down the search space, we propose a novel candidate retrieval paradigm based on entity profiling. Wikidata entities and their textual fields are first indexed into a text search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch). During inference, given a mention and its context, we use a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to generate the profile of the target entity, which consists of its title and description. We use the profile to query the indexed search engine to retrieve candidate entities. Our approach complements the traditional approach of using a Wikipedia anchor-text dictionary, enabling us to further design a highly effective hybrid method for candidate retrieval.

7Oed3xqyEp-,Improving Fairness without Demographic by Lagged Dynamic Grouping,"Machine learning models are prone to social biases in datasets and thus could make discriminatory decisions against demographic minority groups. Most existing fairness-promoting methods usually assume access to the annotations of the demographic information. However, such information could be inaccessible due to the high data annotation cost and privacy restrictions. Recently, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques have been applied to promote fairness without demographic labels. DRO-based methods optimize the individuals/groups with the worst prediction performance, with the intuition that these groups roughly correspond to the minority groups being biased against. However, in complex real-world settings with multiple strong bias attributes, the simple grouping schemes in the existing DRO-based methods can fail to identify the ground truth minority groups. In this paper, we propose FreeDRO, a demographic-free group DRO method featuring a more principled grouping scheme, call lagged dynamic grouping. Specifically, FreeDRO dynamically splits the training data based on the ground truth labels and the prediction of the model at an earlier iteration and then optimizes worst group performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that our method can effectively alleviate the biases and even achieve comparable results with methods with full demographic annotations. The results also verify that our grouping scheme has a good correspondence with the ground truth demographic grouping.",january,True,28.47737756466604,4.977262149807675

A Causal Analysis of the Impact of Translationese on Machine Translation Performance ,"Human-translated text displays distinct features from naturally written text in the same language. This phenomena, known as translationese, has been argued to confound the machine translation (MT) evaluation. Yet, we find that existing work on translationese neglects some important factors and the conclusions are mostly correlational but not causal. In this work, we collect CausalMT, a dataset where the MT training data are also labeled with the human translation directions. We inspect two critical factors, the train-test alignment (whether the human translation directions in the training and test sets are aligned), and data-model alignment (whether the model learns in the same direction as the human translation direction in the dataset). We show that these two factors have a large causal effect on the MT performance, in addition to the test-model misalignment highlighted by existing work on the impact of translationese in the test set. In light of our findings, we provide a set of suggestions for MT training and evaluation. ",january,True,19.18201638909226,-23.93710071010095

The primary example would be parent-child relationships between header cells. Most prior datasets of tables annotated from images or pdf and most models for extracting table structure concentrate on the problems of table boundaries, cell, row, and column bounding box extraction. The area of fine-grained table structure remains relatively unexplored.   This study presents a dataset of 657 tables, manually labeled for cell types and column hierarchy relations. The tables are selected from IBM FinTabNet. The selection of these 657 tables is performed using heuristics, resulting in a much larger proportion, roughly half, of the selected tables having a complex hierarchical structure than a random sample from FinTabNet. Further, we fine-tune models based on LayoutLM on the cell-type classification task and identify hierarchical relations among column headers. We achieve F1 scores of 97% and 73% on the respective tasks. Finally, we use the trained model to create soft labels for the entirety of FinTabNet",january,True,6.714972799585337,13.35337972635092

A text-to-text framework has pushed the unification of the model. However, the framework remains limited because it does not allow contents with a layout for input and has a basic assumption that the task can be solved in a single step. To address these limitations, in this paper, we explore a new framework in which a model performs a task by manipulating displayed web pages in multiple steps. We develop two types of task web pages with different levels of difficulty and propose a BERT extension for the framework. We trained the BERT extension with those task pages jointly, and the following observations were made. (1) The model maintains its performance greater than 80% of that of the original BERT separately fine-tuned in a single-step framework in five out of six tasks. (2) The model learned to solve both tasks of difficulty level.  (3) The model did not generalize effectively on unseen tasks.

The rise of contextualized and massively pre-trained language models like BERT have seen static models becoming surpassed for most NLP tasks. Nevertheless, due to innate architectural and use differences, BERT requires adaptation for knowledge mining. This study tests the suitability of BERT-derived word embeddings for knowledge mining purposes. It utilizes a variation of the approach described by Bommasani et al.

It is conducted using a biomedical corpus, a biomedical BERT variation and validated using domain-specific intrinsic benchmarking tools. Novel, layer-wise BERT performance characteristics are demonstrated. A key finding is that layer-wise intrinsic performance differs for nouns and verbs. Performance also varies according to whether a word of interest belongs to BERT's native vocabulary or is built from sub-word representations: BERT-native representations perform best when extracted from earlier layers, while representations requiring multiple tokens perform best when extracted from the middle-to-latter model layers.

Given a new, unseen input, our model can then use feedback from similar, past cases to repair output errors that may occur. We instantiate our approach using an existing, fixed model for script generation, that takes a goal (e.g., ""bake a cake"") and generates a partially ordered sequence of actions to achieve that goal, sometimes containing errors. We show that our memory-enhanced system, FBNet, learns to apply user feedback effectively to repair such errors (up to 30 points improvement), while making a start at avoiding similar past mistakes on new, unseen examples  (up to 7 points improvement in a controlled setting).

AC8P4mj14AM,ITA: Image-Text Alignments for Multi-Modal Named Entity Recognition,"Recently, Multi-modal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) has attracted a lot of attention. Most of the work utilizes image information through region-level visual representations obtained from a pretrained object detector and  relies on an attention mechanism to model the interactions between image and text representations. However, it is difficult to model such interactions as image and text representations are trained separately on the data of their respective modality and are not aligned in the same space. As text representations take the most important role in MNER, in this paper, we propose {\bf I}mage-{\bf t}ext {\bf A}lignments (ITA) to  align image features into the textual space, so that the attention mechanism in transformer-based pretrained textual embeddings can be better utilized. ITA first aligns the image into regional object tags, image-level captions and optical characters as visual contexts, concatenates them with the input texts as a new cross-modal input, and then feeds it into a pretrained textual embedding model. This makes it easier for the attention module of a pretrained textual embedding model to model the interaction between the two modalities since they are both represented in the textual space. ITA further aligns the output distributions predicted from the cross-modal input and textual input views so that the MNER model can be more practical and robust to noises from images. In our experiments, we show that ITA models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-modal Named Entity Recognition datasets, even without image information.

Earlier named entity translation methods mainly focus on phonetic transliteration, which ignores the sentence context for translation and is limited in domain and language coverage. To address this limitation, we propose DEEP, a DEnoising Entity Pre-training method that leverages large amounts of monolingual data and a knowledge base to improve named entity translation accuracy within sentences. Besides, we investigate a multi-task learning strategy that finetunes a pre-trained neural machine translation model on both entity-augmented monolingual data and parallel data to further improve entity translation. Experimental results on three language pairs demonstrate that DEEP results in significant improvements over strong denoising auto-encoding baselines, with a gain of up to 1.3 BLEU and up to 9.2 entity accuracy points for English-Russian translation.",january,True,17.60355040973238,-23.076508583680678

LGG1BDdBf6T,Imagination-Augmented Natural Language Understanding,"Human brains integrate linguistic and perceptual information simultaneously to understand natural language and hold the critical ability to render imaginations. Such abilities enable us to construct new abstract concepts or concrete objects and are essential in involving applicable knowledge to solve problems in low-resource scenarios.  However, most existing methods for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) are mainly focused on textual signals. They do not simulate human visual imagination ability, which hinders models from inferring and learning efficiently from limited data samples. Therefore, we introduce an Imagination-Augmented Cross-modal Encoder (iACE) to solve natural language understanding tasks from a novel learning perspective---imagination-augmented cross-modal understanding. iACE enables visual imagination with the external knowledge transferred from the powerful generative model and pre-trained vision-and-language model.

In this work, we target on addressing these issues by proposing posterior consistency regularization. Specifically, we first apply stochastic data augmentation on the input samples to better adapt the model for inference circumstance, and then perform consistency training on posterior latent variables to train a more robust posterior network with better latent representations.

Our goal is to reliably determine the dialect before the full utterance is given as input. The major part of the previous research on dialect identification has been model-centric with a focus on performance. We address a new question: How much input is needed to identify a dialect? Our approach is a data-centric analysis that results in general criteria for finding the shortest input needed to make a plausible guess. Working with two sets of dialects (Swiss German and Indo-Aryan languages), we show that the dialect can be identified well before the end of the input utterance. To determine the optimal point for making the first guess, we propose a heuristic that involves calibrated model confidence (temperature scaling) and input length. We show that the same input shortening criteria apply to both of our data sets. While the performance with the early guesses is still below the performance on the full input, the gap is smaller when the overall performance of the fine-tuned model is better.",january,True,5.907075627796205,-25.762800569366437

Exploiting the transformer architecture behind BERT, results improved rapidly and efforts in this direction still continue today. Our contribution to this body of research is a holistic comparison of six different architectures which achieved (near) state-of-the-art results at some point in time. We utilize a broad spectrum of five benchmark data sets and introduce a fixed setting with respect to the pre-processing, the train/validation splits, the performance measures and the quantification of uncertainty. Overall, our findings are two-fold: First, we find that the results reported in the scientific articles are hardly reproducible, since in our experiments the observed performance (most of the time) fell short of the reported one. Second, the results are burdened with notable uncertainty (depending on the data splits) which is why a reporting of uncertainty measures is crucial.",january,True,-25.317163266139186,23.621356957111576

We discover that BERT risks neglecting the contextual word similarity in pre-training. To tackle this issue, we propose an auxiliary gloss regularizer module to BERT pre-training (GR-BERT), to enhance word semantic similarity. By predicting masked words and aligning contextual embeddings to corresponding glosses simultaneously, the word similarity can be explicitly modeled. We design two architectures for GR-BERT and evaluate our model in downstream tasks.

Our results show that, while commonsense and narrative features can help improve performance overall, detecting event boundaries that are more subjective remains challenging for our model.

However, performance has been shown to strongly depend on the selected training examples (termed prompts). In this work, we propose an efficient method for retrieving prompts for in-context learning using annotated data and an LM. Given an input-output pair, we estimate the probability of the output given the input and a candidate training example as the prompt, and label training examples as positive or negative based on this probability. We then train an efficient dense retriever from this data, which is used to retrieve training examples as prompts at test time.

In addition, when the graph density increases, the word nodes become over-smooth. As a result, the semantic information of the document is destroyed. In this paper, TextGRNN, a text classification method based on GNN is proposed to solve the above problems. First, our proposed model constructs the document-level graph via Visibility Graph, in which the graph density is restrained, and updates the word representations by GNN. Then the TextGRNN model utilizes Bi-LSTM that can recognize word order to learn the semantic information of the document. Finally, the attention mechanism is used to highlight the essential words.

Meanwhile, efforts to improve generation models tend to focus on simple n-gram overlap metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). We argue that new advances on models and metrics should each more directly benefit and inform the other. We therefore propose a generalization of leaderboards, bidimensional leaderboards (Billboards), that simultaneously tracks progress in language generation tasks and metrics for their evaluation. Unlike conventional unidimensional leaderboards that sort submitted systems by predetermined metrics, a Billboard accepts both generators and evaluation metrics as competing entries. A Billboard automatically creates an ensemble metric that selects and linearly combines a few metrics based on a global analysis across generators. Further, metrics are ranked based on their correlation with human judgments. We release four Billboards for machine translation, summarization, and image captioning. We demonstrate that a linear ensemble of a few diverse metrics sometimes substantially outperforms existing metrics in isolation. Our mixed-effects model analysis shows that most automatic metrics, especially the reference-based ones, overrate machine over human generation, demonstrating the importance of updating metrics as generation models become stronger (and perhaps more similar to humans) in the future.

The recently developed prompt-based methods freeze the entire model parameters and only update the so-called prompt parameters appended to the inputs, significantly reducing the burden of fully fine-tuning. However, standard prompt-based methods mainly consider the case where sufficient data of downstream tasks are available. It is still unclear whether the advantage can be transferred to the few-shot regime, where only limited data are available for each downstream task. Our empirical studies suggest there is still a gap between prompt tuning and fully fine-tuning for few-shot learning. We propose a new prompt-tuning framework, called Soft Template Tuning (STT), to bridge the gap. STT combines manual prompts and auto-prompts, and treats downstream classification tasks as a masked language modeling task. STT can close the gap between fine-tuning and prompt-based methods without introducing additional parameters. Importantly, it can even outperform the time- and resource-consuming fine-tuning method on sentiment classification tasks. ",january,True,-4.277788714992411,-26.351933314109264

We investigate continual learning for Visual Question Answering and show that performance highly depends on task design, order, and similarity - where tasks may be formulated according to either modality. Our results suggest that incremental learning of language reasoning skills (such as questions about color, count etc.) is more difficult than incrementally learning visual categories. We show that this difficulty is related to task similarity, where heterogeneous tasks lead to more severe forgetting. We also demonstrate that naive finetuning of pretrained models is insufficient, and recent continual learning approaches can reduce forgetting by more than 20%.

DaMdDahWDlu,QubitE: Qubit Embedding for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations to predict missing facts based on existing ones.  Quantum-based KGEs utilize variational quantum circuits for link prediction and score triples via the probability distribution of measuring the qubit states. But current quantum-based KGEs either lose quantum advantages during optimizing, or require a large number of parameters to store quantum states, thus leading to overfitting and low performance. Besides, they ignore theoretical analysis which are essential for understanding the model performance.  To address performance issue and bridge theory gap, we propose QubitE which is lightweight and suitable for link prediction task. In addition, our model preserves quantum advantages which enable quantum logical computing based on semantics. Furthermore, we prove that (1) QubitE is full-expressive; (2) QubitE can infer various relation patterns including symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and commutative/non-commutative composition; (3) QubitE subsumes several existing approaches, \eg~DistMult, pRotatE, RotatE, TransE and ComplEx; (4) QubitE owns linear space complexity and linear time complexity.  Experiments on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs demonstrate that QubitE can achieve comparable results to the state-of-the-art classical models.",january,True,-39.82735766732402,0.6936695772589598

D0zGt8jxCIl,Understand before Answer: Improve Temporal Reading Comprehension via Precise Question Understanding,"This work studies temporal reading comprehension (TRC), which reads a free-text passage and answers temporal ordering questions. Precise question understanding is critical for temporal reading comprehension. For example, the question ""What happened before the victory"" and ""What happened after the victory"" share almost all words except one, while their answers are totally different. Moreover, even if two questions query about similar temporal relations, different varieties might also lead to various answers. For example, although both the question ""What usually happened during the press release?"" and ""What might happen during the press release"" query events which happen after ""the press release"", they convey divergent semantics. To this end, we propose a novel reading comprehension approach with precise question understanding. Specifically, a temporal ordering question is embedded into two vectors to capture the referred event and the temporal relation. Then we evaluate the temporal relation between candidate events and the referred event based on that. Such fine-grained representations offer two benefits. First, it enables a better understanding of the question by focusing on different elements of a question. Second, it provides good interpretability when evaluating temporal relations. Furthermore, we also harness an auxiliary contrastive loss for representation learning of temporal relations, which aims to distinguish relations with subtle but critical changes.  The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TORQUE dataset. It also increases the accuracy of four pre-trained language models (BERT base, BERT large, RoBERTa base, and RoBETRa large), demonstrating its generic effectiveness on divergent models.",january,True,2.2660801352460105,11.77091007835274

However, many significance tests involve hard computation problems, and so we rely on approximation methods such as Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we provide an exact dynamic programming algorithm that runs in quadratic time in the size of the dataset and performs the paired permutation test, a widely used test in comparing two systems, for the case of comparing accuracies between two classification systems. We show that Monte Carlo approximations are often too noisy to reliably determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis. We show that Monte Carlo approximations are often too noisy to reliably determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis with a significance level of $\threshold\approx 0.05$ for any number of sentence $N$.

Evaluating the factual consistency of summaries is thus necessary to develop better models. However, the human evaluation setup for evaluating factual consistency has not been standardized. To determine the factors that affect the reliability of the human evaluation, we crowdsource evaluations for factual consistency across state-of-the-art models on two news summarization datasets using the rating-based Likert Scale and ranking-based Best-Worst Scaling. Our analysis reveals that the ranking-based Best-Worst Scaling offers a more reliable measure of summary quality across datasets and that the reliability of Likert ratings highly depends on the target dataset and the evaluation design. To improve crowdsourcing reliability,  we extend the scale of the Likert rating and present a scoring algorithm for Best-Worst Scaling that we call value learning.

Existing models solve this problem by using neural layers to adaptively capture related intent information for each slot, which the process of intent selection is not clear enough. It is observed that there is strong consistency between intents and topics of a sentence, thus we exploit topic information for joint intent detection and slot filling via a topic fusion mechanism, where token-level topic information take the place of intent information to guide slot prediction.

FHIJtI0HICU,Transferring Knowledge from Structure-aware Self-attention Language Model to Sequence-to-Sequence Semantic Parsing,"Semantic parsing considers the task of mapping a natural language sentence into a target formal representation, where various sophisticated sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models have been applied with promising results. Generally, these target representations follow a syntax formalism that limits permitted forms. However, it is neither easy nor flexible to explicitly integrate this syntax formalism into a neural seq2seq model. In this paper, we present a structure-aware self-attention language model to capture structural information of target representations and propose a knowledge distillation based approach to incorporating the target language model into a seq2seq model, where grammar rules, sketches or extra corpus are not required in the training process.

MIMIC-III is a de-identified EHR database containing observations from over 40,000 patients in critical care units. Since medical notes are free-text, existing machine learning models may have ineffective interpretability; however, interpretability is often desirable for clinical diagnosis. Hence, in this paper, we propose a text mining and pattern discovery solution to discover strong association patterns from patient discharge summaries and the code of international classification of diseases (ICD9 code).

In order to avoid the number representation issue and reduce the search space of feasible solutions, existing works striving for MWP solving usually replace real numbers with symbolic placeholders to focus on logic reasoning. However, different from common symbolic reasoning tasks like program synthesis and knowledge graph reasoning, MWP solving has extra requirements in numerical reasoning. In other words, instead of the number value itself, it is the reusable numerical property that matters more in numerical reasoning. Therefore, we argue that injecting numerical properties into symbolic placeholders with contextualized representation learning schema can provide a way out of the dilemma in the number representation issue here. In this work, we introduce this idea to the popular pre-training language model (PLM) techniques and build MWP-BERT, an effective contextual number representation PLM.

It is a sequence learning problem from image to handwriting stroke sequence where Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a preferred loss function. However, aligning two varying length sequences in DTW loss accumulates the differences of predicted and ground truth strokes for the entire line-level text. As a result, averaging over long sequences in DTW loss, it cannot distinguish between a small number of perceptually significant errors and a large number of visually insignificant errors. To address this issue, we propose two new strategies. First, we propose applying DTW to words instead of line-level text so that the DTW loss for all the words in the line-level text is not averaged out. Moreover, for aligning the predicted and ground-truth sequences for each word, we propose to weight the cost matrix with a Gaussian function so that the far-off predicted strokes from ground truth are penalized heavily.

However, as the sequence length of a BERT model is limited, the framework can not contain too much knowledge besides the original input sentences and is thus forced to discard some knowledge. The problem is especially severe for those downstream tasks that input is a long paragraph or even a document, such as QA or reading comprehension tasks. To address the problem, we propose Roof-BERT, a model with two underlying BERTs and a fusion layer on them.

While our models trained with automated paraphrases generated by pretrained language models do not outperform supervised models trained with similar amounts of human-generated domain-specific data, they perform well in a zero-shot setting, where no domain-specific data is available for a new domain. Additionally, unlike the current state-of-the-art in zero-shot semantic parsing, our approach does not require the use of large transformer-based language models at inference-time.

We seek to go beyond this paradigm by (1) effectively expressing the relations of content pieces in the table, and (2) making our model robust to content-invariant structural transformations. Accordingly, we propose an equivariance learning framework, encoding tables with a structure-aware self-attention mechanism. This prunes the full self-attention structure into an order-invariant graph attention that captures the connected graph structure of cells belonging to the same row or column, and it differentiates between relevant cells and irrelevant cells from the structural perspective. Our framework also modifies the positional encoding mechanism to preserve the relative position of tokens in the same cell but enforce position invariance among different cells.

We propose two techniques that tackle this issue for text classification and tagging tasks, offering a substantial reduction of AL iteration duration and the computational overhead introduced by deep acquisition models in AL. We also demonstrate that our algorithm that leverages pseudolabeling and distilled models overcomes one of the essential obstacles revealed previously in the literature. Namely, it was shown that due to differences between an acquisition model used to select instances during AL and a successor model trained on the labeled data, the benefits of AL can diminish.

However, previous studies have claimed that this form of subword tokenization is inadequate for processing morphologically-rich languages (MRLs). We revisit this hypothesis by pretraining a BERT-style masked language model over character sequences instead of word-pieces. We compare the resulting model, dubbed TavBERT, against contemporary PLMs based on subwords for three highly complex and ambiguous MRLs (Hebrew, Turkish, and Arabic), testing them on both morphological and semantic tasks. Our results show, for all tested languages, that while TavBERT obtains mild improvements on surface-level tasks à la POS tagging and full morphological disambiguation, subword-based PLMs achieve significantly higher performance on semantic tasks, such as named entity recognition and extractive question answering. These results showcase and (re)confirm the potential of subword tokenization as a reasonable modeling assumption for many languages, including MRLs.",january,True,-6.009852176824333,-21.047222777220522

wHlujJiFYfj,Event Detection via Derangement Reading Comprehension,"Event detection (ED), aiming to detect events from texts and categorize them, is vital to understanding the actual happenings in real life.  Recently, ED without triggers has been proposed and gained benefits since it relieves the tedious effort of data labeling.  However, it still suffers from several formidable challenges: multi-label, insufficient clues, and imbalanced event types.  We, therefore, propose a novel Derangement mechanism on a machine Reading Comprehension (DRC) framework to tackle the above challenges.  More specially, we treat the input text as {\em Context} and concatenate it with all event types that are deemed as {\em Answers} with an omitted default question.  Thus, by appending input text and event types simultaneously, we can facilitate the power of self-attention in pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, to absorb the semantic relation among them.  Moreover, we design a simple yet effective {\em derangement} mechanism to relieve the imbalanced training.  By introducing such perturbation mainly on major events, we can prohibit major events from excessive learning or implicitly under-sample the instances of the major events.  This yields a more balanced training to resolve the imbalanced learning issue.  The empirical results show that: (1) our proposed framework attains state-of-the-art performance over previous competitive models, and (2) by-product, our model can signify the connection of triggers and arguments to events for further analysis.",january,True,-15.700416549656653,35.212734514778965

While these methods search for correct value equation candidates as pseudo labels, they search among a narrow sub-space of the enormous equation space. To address this problem, we propose a novel search algorithm with combinatorial mathematics ComSearch, which can compress the search space by excluding mathematical equivalent equations. The compression allows the searching algorithm to enumerate all possible equations and obtain high-quality data. We investigate the noise in the pseudo labels that hold wrong mathematical logic, which we refer to as the false-matching problem, and propose a ranking model to denoise the pseudo labels. Our approach holds a flexible framework to utilize two existing supervised math word problem solvers to train pseudo labels, and both achieve state-of-the-art performance in the weak supervision task.

The current state of the art in semantic parsing is to use supervised learning with deep neural networks but this needs a lot of labelled data made by domain experts. To reduce this need, we additionally use a reward signal that comes from completing the AI planning task. We formalize this as a constrained combinatorial contextual bandit problem.

To generate summary sentences that fuse information from different sentences, our extraction component operates at the constituent level; our novel approach to this problem enriches the text with spinal tree information which provides context to the extraction model.

However, detecting adversarial examples in NLP may be crucial for automated task (e.g. review sentiment analysis) that wishes to amass information about a certain population and additionally be a step towards a robust defense system. To this end, we release a dataset for four popular attack methods on four datasets and four NLP models to encourage further research in this field.

xaWIeItQ7zb,Active Gradual Machine Learning for Entity Resolution,"Recent work has shown that the task of entity resolution (ER) can be effectively performed by gradual machine learning (GML). GML begins with some easy instances, which can be automatically labeled by the machine with high accuracy, and then gradually labels more challenging instances by iterative knowledge conveyance in a factor graph. Without involving manual labeling effort, the current GML solution for ER is unsupervised. However, its performance is limited by inaccurate and insufficient knowledge conveyance. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how to improve knowledge conveyance by manual labeling effort. In this paper, we propose an active learning (AL) approach based on GML for ER. It iteratively generates new knowledge in the form of one-sided rules by manual label verification and instills them into a factor graph for improved knowledge conveyance. We first present a technique of knowledge discovery based on genetic mutations, which can generate effective knowledge rules with very small manual verification cost. Then, we demonstrate how to leverage the generated rules for improved knowledge conveyance by measuring their influence over label status by the metric of skyline distance. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by a comparative study on real benchmark data.

Analyzing Translate-train & Few-shot Cross-lingual Transfer,"Translate-train or few-shot cross-lingual transfer can be used to improve the zero-shot performance of multilingual pretrained language models.  Few-shot utilizes high-quality low-quantity samples (often manually translated from the English corpus ). Translate-train employs a machine translation of the English corpus, resulting in samples with lower quality that could be scaled to high quantity. Given the lower cost and higher availability of machine translation compared to manual professional translation, it is important to systematically compare few-shot and translate-train, understand when each has an advantage,  and investigate how to choose the shots to translate in order to increase the few-shot gain.  This work aims to fill this gap: we compare and quantify the performance gain of few-shot vs. translate-train using three different base models and a varying number of samples for three tasks/datasets (XNLI, PAWS-X, XQuAD) spanning 17 languages. We show that scaling up the training data using machine translation gives a larger gain compared to using the small-scale (higher-quality) few-shot data. When few-shot is beneficial, we show that there are random sets of samples that perform better across languages and that the performance on English and on the machine-translation of the samples can both be used to choose the shots to manually translate for an increased few-shot gain.",january,True,14.900380810570393,-28.873087537260282

In this work, we propose Mix and Match LM, a global score-based alternative for controllable text generation that combines arbitrary pretrained black box models for achieving the desired attributes in the generated text without involving any fine-tuning or structural assumptions about the black box models. We interpret the task of controllable generation as drawing samples from an energy-based model whose energy values are a linear combination of scores from black box models that are separately responsible for fluency, the control attribute, and faithfulness to any conditioning context. We use a Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme to sample from this energy-based model using bidirectional context and global attribute features.

One significant shortcoming of $k$NN-MT lies in its inefficiency in identifying the $k$ nearest neighbors of the query representation from the entire datastore, which is prohibitively time-intensive when the datastore size is large.  In this work, we propose \textbf{Faster $k$NN-MT}  to address this issue. The core idea of Faster $k$NN-MT is to use a hierarchical clustering strategy to approximate the distance between the query and a data point in the datastore, which is decomposed into two parts: the distance between the query and the center of the cluster that the data point belongs to, and the distance between the data point and the cluster center. We propose practical ways to compute these two parts in a significantly faster manner. Through extensive experiments on different MT benchmarks, we show that \textbf{Faster $k$NN-MT} is faster than Fast $k$NN-MT \citep{meng2021fast} and only slightly (1.2 times) slower than its vanilla counterpart, while preserving model performance as $k$NN-MT. Faster $k$NN-MT enables the deployment of $k$NN-MT models on real-world MT services. ",january,True,26.413421126484646,-24.481092257876313

ccydKRvl9w9,In-BoXBART: Get Instructions into Biomedical Multi-task Learning,"Single-task models have proven pivotal in solving specific tasks; however, they have limitations in real-world applications where multi-tasking is necessary and domain shifts are exhibited. Recently, instructional prompts have shown significant improvement towards multi-task generalization; however, the effect of instructional prompts and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has not been systematically studied in the biomedical domain. Motivated by this, this paper explores the impact of instructional prompts for biomedical MTL. We introduce the BoX, a collection of 32 instruction tasks for Biomedical NLP across (X) various categories. Using this meta-dataset, we propose a unified model termed as In-BoXBART, that can jointly learn all tasks of the BoX without any task-specific modules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a unified model in the biomedical domain and use instructions to achieve generalization across several biomedical tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model: 1) outperforms single-task baseline by ~3% and multi-task (without instruction) baseline by ~18% on an average, and 2) shows ~23% improvement compared to single-task baseline in few-shot learning (i.e., 32 instances per task) on an average. Our analysis indicates that there is significant room for improvement across tasks in the BoX, implying the scope for future research direction.",january,True,0.9533912076288666,-23.863382872636432

Existing methods train an encoder-decoder-based model to fit all questions. However, the questions in the real world exhibit an imbalanced distribution in many dimensions, such as question type, relation class, entity class, and query structure. This results in insufficient learning for minority class samples under different dimensions. To address this problem, we propose a meta-learning framework for complex question generation. It trains a unique generator for each sample via retrieving a few most related training samples, which can deeply and quickly dive into the content features (e.g. relation and entity) and structure features (e.g. query structure) of each sample.  As retrieved samples directly determine the effectiveness of each unique generator, we design a self-supervised graph retriever to learn the potential features of samples and retrieve the most related samples according to multiple dimensions.  We conduct experiments on both WebQuestionSP and ComplexWebQuestion, the results on the minority class of different dimensions have been significantly improved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",january,True,-1.025641132323845,16.641430059991656

However, short-sequence models typically perform best despite their sequence limits. Confounded by domain shifts between datasets, it has remained unclear whether long premises are truly needed at fine-tuning time to learn long-premise NLI. We construct LawngNLI, with premises that skew much longer than in existing NLI benchmarks and are multigranular: all contain a short version. LawngNLI is constructed from U.S. legal opinions, with automatic labels with high human-validated accuracy. Evaluating on its long-premise NLI, we show top performance is achieved only with fine-tuning using these long premises. Models only fine-tuned on existing datasets and even our short premises (which derive from judge-selected relevant Entail excerpts in source documents) thus controlling for domain underperform considerably. Top performance is by short-sequence models prepended with a standard retrieval method filtering across each premise, but they underperform absent fine-tuning using long premises as inputs. LawngNLI also holds relevance for the legal community, as NLI is a principal cognitive task in developing cases and advice.

Recent works propose distant supervision as a way to tackle the scarcity of annotated data by automatically pairing knowledge graph relationships with raw textual data. In several benchmarks, Distantly Supervised Biomedical Relation Extraction (Bio-DSRE) models can produce very accurate results. However, given the challenging nature of the task, we set out to investigate the validity of such impressive results. We probed the datasets used by \citet{amin2020data} and \citet{hogan2021abstractified} and found a significant overlap between training and evaluation relationships that, once resolved, reduced the accuracy of the models by up to 71\%. Furthermore, we noticed several inconsistencies along the data construction process, such as the creation of negative samples and improper handling of redundant relationships. To mitigate these issues we present \meddistant, a new benchmark dataset obtained by aligning the MEDLINE abstracts with the widely used SNOMED-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) knowledge base.

In contrast to existing approaches, this does not require any explanations for training a separate verification model. We first validate the efficacy of automatic counterfactual hypothesis generation, leveraging on the few-shot priming paradigm.

The model proposed in this paper, called Lex2Sent, is an unsupervised sentiment analysis method to improve the classification of sentiment lexicon methods. For this purpose, a Doc2Vec-model is trained to determine the distances between document embeddings and the embeddings of the positive and negative part of a sentiment lexicon. These distances are then evaluated for multiple executions of Doc2Vec on resampled documents and are averaged to perform the classification task.

Therefore, in this paper, we develop a novel data augmentation framework based on ensembling retriever models that captures the relevant text segments from unlabeled policy documents and expand the positive examples in the training set. In addition, to improve the diversity and the quality of the augmented data, we leverage multiple pre-trained language models (LMs) and cascaded them with noise reduction oracles.

Recent methods extract relational triple from a stereoscopic perspective which can better capture the interaction between entity and relation. However, the stereoscopic models introduce redundant triples, which makes it difficult to  identify triples accurately. Since the relation is one of the elements of triples to be extracted, the introduction of its semantic information can make the triple information more complete, which is helpful to relational triple extraction.

Specifically, a fusion encoder from transformers on top of relation encoder and sentence encoder is designed to enrich the semantic information of relation. Then, the semantic representation of the relation is integrated into the stereoscopic 3D space as its relation dimension.

In this work, we aim to conduct a thorough analysis of these emerging models with large-scale and controlled experiments. For each attention variant, we pretrain large-size models using the same long-doc corpus and then finetune these models for real-world long-context tasks. Our findings reveal pitfalls of an existing widely-used long-range benchmark and show none of the tested efficient attentions can beat a simple local window attention under standard pretraining paradigms.

We investigate two types of knowledge transfer: (1) \textit{text knowledge transfer using image captions that may contain enriched visual knowledge and (2) \textit{cross-modal knowledge transfer} using both images and captions with vision-language training objectives. On 5 downstream tasks that may need visual knowledge to solve the problem, we perform extensive empirical comparisons over the presented objectives. Our experiments show that visual knowledge transfer can improve performance in both low-resource and fully supervised settings.",january,True,9.220159619787141,-9.342772981984671

The current collection of QE datasets is typically based on the exact matching between the words from MT sentences and post-edited sentences through Translation Error Rate (TER) toolkit. However, we find that the data generated by TER cannot faithfully reflect human judgment, which can make the research deviate from the correct direction. To overcome the limitation, we for the first time collect the direct assessment (DA) dataset for the word-level QE task, namely DAQE, which contains the golden corpus annotated by expert translators on two language pairs. Furthermore, we propose two tag correcting strategies, namely tag refinement strategy and tree-based annotation strategy, to make the TER-based artificial QE tags closer to human judgement, so that the corrected TER-based data can be used to improve the QE performance during pre-training. We conduct detailed experiments on our collected DAQE dataset, as well as comparison with the TER-based QE dataset MLQE-PE. The results not only show our proposed dataset DAQE is more consistent with human judgment but also confirm the effectiveness of the pre-training approach with the tag correcting strategies.",january,True,29.144906319368467,-21.263305307967414

Previous approaches generally focus on leveraging textual content to identify stances, while they fail to reason with background knowledge or leverage the rich semantic and syntactic textual labels in news articles. In light of these limitations, we propose KCD, a political perspective detection approach to enable multi-hop knowledge reasoning and incorporate textual cues as paragraph-level labels. Specifically, we firstly generate random walks on external knowledge graphs and infuse them with news text representations. We then construct a heterogeneous information network to jointly model news content as well as semantic, syntactic and entity cues in news articles. Finally, we adopt relational graph neural networks for graph-level representation learning and conduct political perspective detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets.

Motivated by the two-streams hypothesis, we propose a neural architecture, named TraceNet, to address this type of task. It not only learns discriminative representations for the target task via its encoders, but also traces key elements at the same time via its locators.  In TraceNet, both encoders and locators are organized in a layer-wise manner, and a smoothness regularization is employed between adjacent encoder-locator combinations. Moreover, a sparsity constraints are enforced on locators for tracing purposes and items are proactively masked according to the item weights output by locators. A major advantage of TraceNet is that the outcomes are easier to understand, since the most responsible parts of inputs are identified. Also, under the guidance of locators, it is more robust to attacks due to its focus on key elements and the proactive masking training strategy. Experimental results show its effectiveness for sentiment classification. Moreover, we provide several case studies to demonstrate its robustness and interpretability.

However, new practical challenges arise. For instance, current dialog systems cannot effectively handle multiple search results when querying a database, due to the lack of such scenarios in  existing public datasets. In this paper, we propose Database Search Result (DSR) Disambiguation, a novel task that focuses on disambiguating database search results, which enhances user experience by allowing them to choose from multiple options instead of just one. To study this task, we augment the popular task-oriented dialog datasets (MultiWOZ and SGD) with turns that resolve ambiguities by (a) synthetically generating turns through a pre-defined grammar, and (b) collecting human paraphrases for a subset. We find that training on our augmented dialog data improves the model's ability to deal with ambiguous scenarios, without sacrificing performance on unmodified turns. Furthermore, pre-fine tuning and multi-task learning help our model to improve performance on DSR-disambiguation even in the absence of in-domain data, suggesting that it can be learned as a universal dialog skill.

Fh7uOUHXrLO,On the Limitations of Dataset Balancing: The Lost Battle Against Spurious Correlations,"Recent work have shown that deep learning models in NLP are highly sensitive to low-level correlations between simple features and specific output labels, leading to overfitting and lack of generalization. To mitigate this problem, a common practice is to balance datasets by adding new instances or by filtering out ""easy"" instances (Sakaguchi et al., 2020) culminating in a recent proposal to eliminate single-word correlations altogether (Gardner et al., 2021). In this opinion paper, we identify that despite these efforts, increasingly-powerful models keep exploiting ever-smaller spurious correlations, and as a result even balancing all single-word features is insufficient for mitigating all of these correlations.  In parallel, a truly balanced dataset may be bound to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and miss important signal encoding common sense and world knowledge. We highlight several alternatives to dataset balancing, focusing on enhancing datasets with richer contexts, allowing models to abstain and interact with users, and turning from large-scale fine-tuning to zero- or few-shot setups.",january,True,0.8017897015793878,-7.169248027970845

To alleviate data imbalance, we propose a set of sentence-level resampling methods  where the importance of each training sentence is computed based on its tokens and entities. We study the generalizability of these resampling methods on a wide variety of NER models (CRF, Bi-LSTM, and BERT) across corpora from diverse domains (general, social, and medical texts).

To measure the extent of loss of typical gender associations (i.e.\ over-debiasing), we introduce the Typical Associations evaluation corpus for Gender (TA-Gender).

However, this assumption may be unrealistic in real-world situations involving text, as human language is rich and flexible.   We first define the leakage problem, discussing the identification and estimation challenges it raises.

Adversarial training has shown effectiveness in improving generalization by regularizing the change of loss on top of adversarially chosen perturbations. The recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm conducts adversarial weight perturbation, encouraging the model to converge to a flat minima. Unfortunately, due to increased computational cost, adversarial weight perturbation can only be efficiently estimated per-batch instead of per-instance by SAM, leading to degraded performance. In this paper, we tackle this efficiency bottleneck and propose the first instance-based weight perturbation method: sharpness-aware minimization with dynamic reweighting (δ-SAM). δ-SAM dynamically reweights perturbation within each batch by estimated guardedness (i.e. unguarded instances are up-weighted), serving as a better approximation to per-instance perturbation.

For mathematical language modeling, current pre-training methods for transformer-based language models which were originally developed for natural language need to be adapted. In this work, we propose a multi-stage pre-training scheme including natural language and mathematical notation that is applied on ALBERT and BERT, resulting in two models that can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks: $\mu^2$ALBERT and $\mu^2$BERT. We show that both models outperform the current state-of-the-art model on Answer Ranking. Furthermore, a structural probing classifier is applied in order to test whether operator trees can be reconstructed from the models' contextualized embeddings.

URtrOEPzljc,"Hey AI, Can You Solve Complex Tasks by Talking to Agents?","Training giant models from scratch for each complex task is resource- and data-inefficient. To help develop models that can leverage existing systems, we propose a new challenge: Learning to solve complex tasks by communicating with existing agents (or models) in natural language. We design a synthetic benchmark, CommaQA, with three complex reasoning tasks (explicit, implicit, numeric) designed to be solved by communicating with existing QA agents. For instance, using text and table QA agents to answer questions such as ""Who had the longest javelin throw from USA?"". We show that black-box models struggle to learn this task from scratch (accuracy under 50\%) even with access to each agent's knowledge and gold facts supervision. In contrast, models that learn to communicate with agents outperform black-box models, reaching scores of 100\% when given gold decomposition supervision. However, we show that the challenge of learning to solve complex tasks by communicating with existing agents \emph{without relying on any auxiliary supervision or data} still remains highly elusive. We will release CommaQA, along with a compositional generalization test split, to advance research in this direction",january,True,-9.156142632384267,0.16716282650250486

Yet, evaluations of task-oriented dialogue systems are relatively limited. The informative and success score only consider the key entities in the generated responses to judge whether the user's goal is achieved. On the other hand, the fluency metric (BLEU score) cannot measure the quality of the short responses properly since the golden responses could be diversified.  To better explore the behavior and evaluate the generation ability of task-oriented dialogue systems, we explore the relation between user utterances and system responses and their follow-up utterances.  Therefore, we design a scorer named \textbf{DialogueScore} based on the natural language inference task and synthesize negative data to train the scorer. Via performances of \textbf{DialogueScore}, we observe that the dialogue system fails to generate high-quality responses compared with the reference responses.  Therefore, our proposed scorer could provide a new perspective for future dialogue system evaluation and construction.",january,True,-8.35756157499589,11.91493801858773

We utilize multiple knowledge extractors to obtain relation triples from the text, learn a fine-tuned classifier to select content to be included in the summary and use a fine-tuned BART rewriter to rewrite the selected triples into a natural language summary.

However, such models are not practical in that their prediction speed is slow as they need k forward passes to predict k classes and they are not built for fine-tuning to further improve the initial (often mediocre) performance.This work proposes a simple, effective, and practical dataless classification approach. We use class descriptions as queries to retrieve task-specific or external unlabeled data on which  pseudo-labels are assigned to train a classifier.

The redundancy of arguments underlying multiple sentences is beneficial but is often overlooked. In addition, in event argument extraction, the majority entities are regarded as class “others"", i.e. universum class, which is composed of heterogeneous entities without typical common features. Classifiers trained by cross entropy loss could easily misclassify universum class because of their open decision boundary. In this paper, to make use of redundant information underlying a document, we build an entity coreference graph with graph2token module to produce comprehensive and coreference-aware representation for every entity, and then build an entity summary graph to merge the multiple extraction results. To better classify universum class, we propose a new loss function to build classifiers with closed boundaries.

Instead, we argue that it is necessary to formulate a comprehensive evaluation about the linguistic capabilities of models on natural texts. For this purpose, we create a Chinese dataset namely CQMrobust which contains natural questions with linguistic perturbations to evaluate the robustness of question matching models. CQMrobust contains 3 categories and 13 subcategories with 32 linguistic perturbations. The extensive experiments demonstrate that CQMrobust has a better ability to distinguish different models. Importantly, the detailed breakdown of evaluation by linguistic phenomenon in CQMrobust helps us easily diagnose the strength and weakness of different models.

Recent advances in large-scale sequence generation pretraining have seen great success in unifying task formulation for a great variety of tasks, but so far, more complex tasks such as dense video captioning are not able to fully utilize this powerful paradigm. In this work, we show how to model the two subtasks of dense video captioning jointly as one sequence generation task, and simultaneously predict the events and the corresponding descriptions.

9D65hK833L,Should We Rely on Entity Mentions for Relation Extraction? Debiasing Relation Extraction with Counterfactual Analysis,"Recent literature focuses on utilizing the entity information in the sentence-level relation extraction (RE), but this risks leaking superficial and spurious clues of relations. As a result, RE still suffers from unintended entity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and relations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that do not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the entity mentions to prevent the RE models from over-fitting entity mentions. However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the semantic information of entities. In this paper, we propose the CoRE (Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction) debiasing method that guides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without losing the entity information. We first construct a causal graph for RE, which models the dependencies between variables in RE models. Then, we propose to conduct counterfactual analysis on our causal graph to distill and mitigate the entity bias, that captures the causal effects of specific entity mentions in each instance. Note that our CoRE method is model-agnostic to debias existing RE systems during inference without changing their training processes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CoRE yields significant gains on both effectiveness and generalization for RE.",january,True,-26.21749354332532,9.36189682410034

ZJHxuYn-sXn,Measuring Word-Context Biases in Lexical Semantic Datasets,"State-of-the-art contextualized models eg. BERT use tasks such as WiC and WSD to evaluate their word-in-context representations. This inherently assumes that performance in these tasks reflect how well a model represents the coupled word and context semantics. We question this assumption by presenting the first quantitative analysis on the context-word interaction required and being tested in major contextual lexical semantic tasks, taking into account that tasks can be inherently biased and models can learn spurious correlations from datasets. To achieve this, we run probing baselines on masked input, based on which we then propose measures to calculate the degree of context or word biases in a dataset, and plot existing datasets on a continuum. The analysis were performed on both models and humans to decouple biases inherent to the tasks and biases learned from the datasets. We found that, (1) to models, most existing datasets fall into the extreme ends of the continuum: the retrieval-based tasks and especially the ones in the medical domain (eg. COMETA) exhibit strong target word bias while WiC-style tasks and WSD show strong context bias; (2) AM2iCo and Sense Retrieval show less extreme model biases and challenge a model more to represent both the context and target words.  (3) A similar trend of biases exists in humans but humans are much less biased compared with models as humans found semantic judgments more difficult with the masked input, indicating models are learning spurious correlations. This study demonstrates that with heavy context or target word biases, models are usually not being tested for word-in-context representations as such in these tasks and results are therefore open to misinterpretation. We recommend our framework as a sanity check for context and target word biases in future task design and model interpretation in lexical semantics.",january,True,-8.967415902186156,-11.620921787011252

The labeled sentences in a corpus are usually packaged and trained for relation extraction using a multi-instance learning paradigm.

Previous studies that used sentence-level attention mechanisms to de-noise neither considered correlation among sentences in a bag nor correlation among bags. This paper proposes hierarchical attention-based networks that can de-noise at both sentence and bag levels. In the calculation of bag representation, we provide weights to sentence representations using sentence-level attention that considers correlations among sentences in each bag.

Simple fine-tuning of PLMs, on the other hand, might be suboptimal for domain-specific tasks because they cannot possibly cover knowledge from all domains. While adaptive pre-training of PLMs can help them obtain domain-specific knowledge, it requires a large training cost. Moreover, adaptive pre-training can harm the PLM's performance on the downstream task by causing catastrophic forgetting of its general knowledge. To overcome such limitations of adaptive pre-training for PLM adaption, we propose a novel domain adaption framework for PLMs coined as Knowledge-Augmented Language model Adaptation (KALA), which modulates the intermediate hidden representations of PLMs with domain knowledge, consisting of entities and their relational facts. We validate the performance of our KALA on question answering and named entity recognition tasks on multiple datasets across various domains.

bZnoJo7-58T,"When a sentence does not introduce a discourse entity, Transformer-based models still often refer to it","Understanding longer narratives or participating in conversations requires tracking of discourse entities that have been mentioned. Indefinite noun phrases, such as 'a dog', frequently introduce discourse entities but this behavior is modulated by sentential operators such as negation. For example, 'a dog' in 'Arthur doesn't own a dog' does not introduce a discourse entity due to the presence of negation. In this work, we adapt the psycholinguistic assessment of language models paradigm to higher-level linguistic phenomena and introduce an English evaluation suite that targets the knowledge of the interactions between sentential operators and indefinite noun phrases. We use this evaluation suite for a fine-grained investigation of the entity tracking abilities of the Transformer-based models GPT-2 and GPT-3. We find that while the models are to a certain extent sensitive to the interactions we investigate, they are all challenged by the presence of multiple noun phrases and their behavior is not systematic, which suggests that even models at the scale of GPT-3 do not fully acquire basic entity tracking abilities.

Automatically evaluating such inconsistencies may help to alleviate this limitation by accelerating evaluation cycles, filtering inconsistent outputs and annotating large-scale training data. While attracting increasing attention, such evaluation metrics are usually developed and evaluated in silo for a single task or dataset. Moreover, previous meta-evaluation protocols focused on system-level correlations with human annotations, which leave the example-level accuracy of such metrics unclear. In this work, we introduce TRUE: a comprehensive study of factual consistency metrics on a standardized collection of existing texts from diverse tasks, manually annotated for factual consistency. Our standardization enables an example-level meta-evaluation protocol that is more actionable and interpretable than previously reported correlations, yielding clearer quality measures.

Meanwhile, there exist large-scale parallel translation pairs (100x larger than monolingual pairs) that are highly correlated in semantic, but have not been utilized for learning  sentence representation. Furthermore, given parallel translation pairs, previous contrastive learning frameworks can not well balance the monolingual embeddings’ alignment and uniformity which represent the quality of embeddings. In this paper, we build on the top of dual encoder and propose to freeze the source language encoder, utilizing its consistent embeddings to supervise the target language encoder via contrastive learning, where source-target translation pairs are regarded as positives. We provide the first exploration of utilizing parallel translation sentence pairs to learn monolingual sentence embeddings and show superior performance to balance the alignment and uniformity.

While these agents excel at generating high-quality responses that are relevant to prior context, they suffer from a lack of awareness of the overall direction in which the conversation is headed, and the likelihood of task success inherent therein. Thus, we propose a framework in which dialogue agents can evaluate the progression of a conversation toward or away from desired outcomes, and use this signal to inform planning for subsequent responses. Our framework is composed of three key elements: (1) the notion of a ""global"" dialogue state (GDS) space, (2) a task-specific progression function (PF) computed in terms of a conversation's trajectory through this space, and (3) a planning mechanism by which a dialogue agent may use progression signals to select its next response.",january,True,-14.794512791267053,14.526222761507906

To address this question, we introduce Fig-QA, a Winograd-style nonliteral language understanding task consisting of correctly interpreting paired figurative phrases with divergent meanings. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art language models on this task, and find that although language models achieve performance significantly over chance, they still fall  short of human performance, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.

We show that compression, which can be quantified by, e.g., sentence retrieval or centered kernel alignment, is compatible with performance and privacy, but that performance and privacy are at odds, leading to non-linear interactions between compression, performance, and privacy. We also demonstrate that privacy is at odds with interpretability, leading to non-linear interactions between compression, privacy, and interpretability. Finally, while fairness and privacy are generally at odds, we show that in the multilingual space, fairness and privacy have common solutions.

A key contribution is the combination of semi-automatic resource building for extraction of domain-dependent concern types (with 2-4 hours of human labor per domain) and an entirely automatic procedure for extraction of domain-independent moral dimensions and endorsement values.  Prudent (automatic) selection of terms from propositional structures for lexical expansion (via semantic similarity) produces new moral dimension lexicons at three levels of granularity beyond a strong baseline lexicon. We develop a ground truth (GT) based on expert annotators and compare our concern detection output to GT, to yield 231% improvement in recall over baseline, with only a 10% loss in precision. F1 yields 66% improvement over baseline and 97.8% of human performance. Moreover, our lexically based approach yields large savings over approaches that employ costly human labor and model building.

It is exceedingly expensive to train these models in other languages. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel method -- called WECHSEL -- to efficiently and effectively transfer pretrained LMs to new languages. WECHSEL can be applied to any model which uses subword-based tokenization and learns an embedding for each subword. The tokenizer of the source model (in English) is replaced with a tokenizer in the target language and token embeddings are initialized such that they are semantically similar to the English tokens by utilizing multilingual static word embeddings covering English and the target language. We use WECHSEL to transfer the English RoBERTa and GPT-2 models to four languages (French, German, Chinese and Swahili). We also study the benefits of our method on very low-resource languages. WECHSEL improves over proposed methods for cross-lingual parameter transfer and outperforms models of comparable size trained from scratch with up to 64x less training effort.

Some works use the hierarchy of relations for knowledge transfer to long-tail relations. However, a coarse-grained relation often implies only an attribute (e.g., domain or topic) of the distant fact, making it hard to discriminate relations based solely on sentence semantics. One solution is resorting to entity types, but open questions remain about how to fully leverage the information of entity types and how to align multi-granular entity types with sentences. In this work, we propose a novel model to enrich distantly-supervised sentences with entity types. It consists of (1) a pairwise type-enriched sentence encoding module injecting both context-free and -related backgrounds to alleviate sentence-level wrong labeling, and (2) a hierarchical type-sentence alignment module enriching a sentence with the triple fact's basic attributes to support long-tail relations.

_nY7qzxZoT,Exploring Example Selection for Few-shot Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing,"We study example selection methods for few-shot text-to-SQL tasks with unseen databases. Annotating natural language questions with corresponding SQL queries is expensive, but we can use abundant unlabeled questions to efficiently select examples to annotate and then use them to adapt models. Many previous works only randomly sample a few instances for few-shot learning, but this random selection is not sufficient to select representative and informative examples that provide specific domain knowledge. We thus explore methods to efficiently choose annotation examples. We identify two important factors: the diversity of selected instances and the dissimilarity to the source training data if any. A diverse training set contains more domain knowledge, while dissimilar examples are selected to fill in the domain gap between the source and target. We show that our best example selection approach substantially improves few-shot text-to-SQL performance in both finetuning using T5 and in-context learning with Codex: average execution accuracy gains of 8.7% and 4.3% over random selection. Our extensive analysis demonstrates the importance of the similarity metric and the embedding method for example representations. We also find that effective example selection reduces syntax errors on the target domains. Our results encourage future work to further explore example selection for efficient adaptation of text-to-SQL models.",january,True,7.508238821929335,9.984832623364174

Existing QA works mostly focus on specific question types, knowledge domains, or reasoning skills. The specialty in QA research hinders systems from modeling commonalities between tasks and generalization for wider applications. To address this issue, we present ProQA, a unified QA paradigm that solves various tasks through a single model. ProQA takes a unified structural prompt as the bridge and improves the QA-centric ability by structural prompt-based pre-training. Through a structurally designed prompt-based input schema, ProQA concurrently models the knowledge generalization for all QA tasks while keeping the knowledge customization for every specific QA task. Furthermore, ProQA is pre-trained with structural prompt-formatted large-scale synthesized corpus, which empowers the model with the commonly-required QA ability. Experimental results on 11 QA benchmarks demonstrate that ProQA consistently boosts performance on both full data fine-tuning, few-shot learning, and zero-shot testing scenarios. Furthermore, ProQA exhibits strong ability in both continual learning and transfer learning by taking the advantages of the structural prompt.",january,True,-1.2385459088453576,19.630163417831664

Beyond its practical utility, the dataset also presents a unique NLP challenge, as the first relation extraction dataset consisting of variable-length relations.

In particular, many researchers utilized various linguistic features to identify users with mental disorders. However, generalizing linguistic features of such psychiatric patients is challenging since these features are apparently dependent on cultural or personal language habits. To address this challenge, we make use of the symptoms, which are shared properties of people with mental illness, concerning clinical contents rather than the ways of expressing them. In this paper, we aim to let our classification model identify informative features by training on knowledge about the symptoms. To this end, we propose a multi-head siamese network, which captures informative features based on the knowledge of mental illness symptoms and compares them to those of target text to be classified. The model is designed to learn the required knowledge by reading just a few questions from self-tests, and to identify similar stories from social media texts. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves improved performance as well as human-interpretable results for mental illness symptoms. A case study shows that our proposed model offers the possibility of automatic mental illness diagnosis, grounded on rational reasons.",january,True,-20.61431961490389,20.628343889605596
o1LLnx21iVj,Connecting the Dots between Audio and Text without Parallel Data through Visual Knowledge Transfer,"Machines that can represent and describe environmental soundscapes have practical potential, e.g., for audio tagging and captioning. Prevailing learning paradigms of audio-text connections have been relying on parallel audio-text data, which is, however, scarcely available on the web. We propose VIP-ANT that induces Audio-Text alignment without using any parallel audio-text data. Our key idea is to share the image modality between bi-modal image-text representations and bi-modal image-audio representations; the image modality functions as a pivot and connects audio and text in a tri-modal embedding space implicitly.  In a difficult zero-shot setting with no paired audio-text data, our model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the ESC50 and US8K audio classification tasks, and even surpasses the supervised state of the art for Clotho caption retrieval (with audio queries) by 2.2% R@1. We further investigate cases of minimal audio-text supervision, finding that, e.g., just a few hundred supervised audio-text pairs increase the zero-shot audio classification accuracy by 8% on US8K. However, to match human parity on some zero-shot tasks, our empirical scaling experiments suggest that we would need about $2^{21} \approx 2\text{M}$ supervised audio-caption pairs.

In our case study of LXMERT, a state-of-the-art VL model, we probe the use of the PI in the representation and study its effect on Visual Question Answering. We show that the model is not capable of leveraging the PI for image-text matching task on a challenge set where only position differs. Yet, our experiments with probing confirm that the PI is indeed present in the representation. We introduce two strategies (i) Positional Information Pre-training and (ii) Contrastive Learning on PI using Cross-Modality Matching. Doing so, the model can correctly classify if image with detailed PI statements matches. Additionally to the 2D information from bounding boxes, we introduce the object's depth as a new feature for a better object localization in the space. Even though we were able to improve the model properties as defined by our probes, it only has a negligible effect on the downstream performance. Our results thus highlight an important issue of multimodal modeling: the mere presence of information detectable by a probing classifier is not a guarantee that the information is available in a cross-modal setup.",january,True,2.1835021730557895,9.476465458286054

However, we find that this learning paradigm inherits the vulnerability from the pre-training stage, where model predictions can be misled by inserting certain triggers into the text. In this paper, we explore this universal vulnerability by either injecting \textit{backdoor triggers} or searching for \textit{adversarial triggers} on pre-trained language models using only plain text. In both scenarios, we demonstrate that our triggers can totally control or severely decrease the performance of prompt-based models fine-tuned on arbitrary downstream tasks, reflecting the universal vulnerability of the prompt-based learning paradigm. Further experiments show that adversarial triggers have good transferability among language models. We also find conventional fine-tuning models are not vulnerable to adversarial triggers constructed from pre-trained language models.

It builds on recently proposed planning-based neural generation models that are trained to first create a composition of the output using an entity chain and then continue to generate conditioned on the entity chain and the input (Narayan et al, 2021). Our approach avoids text degeneration by first sampling a composition in the form of an entity chain and then using beam search to generate the best possible text grounded to the entity chain. Experiments on summarization (CNN/DailyMail and XSum) and SQuAD question generation tasks, using a wide variety of automatic metrics and human-based evaluation, demonstrate that Composition Sampling is currently the best available decoding strategy for generating diverse meaningful outputs.

To address these challenges, we develop a Retrieve-Generate-Filter(RGF) technique to create counterfactual evaluation and training data with minimal human supervision. Using an open-domain QA framework and question generation model trained on original task data, we create counterfactuals that are fluent, semantically diverse, and automatically labeled.

Specifically, over a set of candidate templates, we choose the template that maximizes the mutual information between the input and the corresponding model output. Across 8 datasets representing 7 distinct NLP tasks, we show that when a template has high mutual information, it also has high accuracy on the task.

Recent multimodal models induce soft local alignments between modalities (image regions and sentences). This is of particular interest in the medical domain, where alignments could serve to highlight regions in an image relevant to specific phenomena described in free-text. Past work has presented example “heatmaps” as qualitative evidence that cross-modal soft alignments can be interpreted in this manner. However, there has been little quantitative evaluation of such alignments. Here we compare alignments from a state-of-the-art multimodal (image and text) model for EHR with human annotations that associate image regions with sentences. Our main finding is that the text has surprisingly little influence on the attention; alignments do not consistently reflect basic anatomical information. Moreover, synthetic modifications, such as substituting ""left"" for ""right,"" do not substantially influence attention.

We investigate the utility of rationales as an additional source of supervision, by varying the quantity and quality of rationales during training. After controlling for instances where rationales leak the correct answer, we find that incorporating only 5% of rationales during training can boost model performance by 16.89%.

The global property features act as dataset-level prior knowledge for RE, and a complement to the sentence-level features.

Unlike previous approaches, ParaBLEU learns to understand paraphrasis using generative conditioning as a pretraining objective. ParaBLEU correlates more strongly with human judgements than existing metrics, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on the 2017 WMT Metrics Shared Task. We show that our model is robust to data scarcity, exceeding previous state-of-the-art performance using only 50% of the available training data and surpassing BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR with only 40 labelled examples.

Further, such general purpose ASRs typically output multiple alternative hypotheses for the same input utterance. In this paper, we consider the hypothesis re-ordering framework and evaluate the impact of three different scoring functions for re-ordering the hypotheses: phoneme-based, character-based and word-based, and determine their strengths and weaknesses. Based on our intuitions and experimental validation, we determine that phoneme-based scoring is the best for closed domain contexts, while character-based and word-based scoring do better in case of more open-domain contexts. Our results show that character-based scoring gives the best performance improvement in terms of word error rate over general purpose ASRs for voice assistants used in a classroom context. Our analysis also reveals that character-based scoring is preferred for shorter utterances while word-based scoring is preferred for longer utterances.",january,True,18.926600708085626,-15.803527042783188

After injected into a backdoor, a deep neural model will behave normally on standard inputs but give adversary-specified predictions once the input contains specific backdoor triggers. Current textual backdoor attacks have poor attack performance in some tough situations. In this paper, we find two simple tricks that can make existing textual backdoor attacks much more harmful. The first trick is to add an extra training task to distinguish poisoned and clean data during the training of the victim model, and the second one is to use all the clean training data rather than remove the original clean data corresponding to the poisoned data. These two tricks are universally applicable to different attack models. We conduct experiments in three tough situations including clean data fine-tuning, low-poisoning-rate, and label-consistent attacks. Experimental results show that the two tricks can significantly improve attack performance. This paper exhibits the great potential harmfulness of backdoor attacks.

It has been difficult to build VLN models that can generalize as well as humans. In this paper, we provide a new perspective that accommodates the potential variety of interpretations of verbal instructions. We discovered that snapshots of a VLN model, i.e., model versions based on parameters saved at various intervals during its training, behave significantly differently even when their navigation success rates are almost the same.  We thus propose a snapshot-based ensemble solution that leverages predictions provided by multiple snapshots. Our approach is effective and generalizable, and can be applied to ensemble snapshots from different models.

In this work, we investigate an interactive semantic parsing framework that explains the predicted LF step by step in natural language and enables the user to make corrections through natural-language feedback for individual steps.

We argue that one step forward to overcome this limitation is to better understand the behavioral trend of PLMs at each hop over the inference chain. Our critical underlying idea is to mimic human-style reasoning: we envision the multi-hop reasoning process as a sequence of explicit one-hop incremental reasoning steps. Using the SHINRA and ConceptNet resources jointly, we provide automatically generated datasets built upon a set of inference heuristics on relevant phrases and distractors, allowing us to teach the models incremental reasoning skills.

LrR-9tt62rw,An Encoder Attribution Analysis for Dense Passage Retriever in Open-Domain Question Answering,"The bi-encoder design of dense passage retriever (DPR) is a key factor to its success in open-domain question answering (QA). However, it is unclear how DPR's question encoder and passage encoder individually contributes to the overall performance, which we refer to as the encoder attribution problem. The problem is important as it helps us isolate responsible factors for individual encoders to further improve overall performance. In this paper, we formulate our analysis under a probabilistic framework called encoder marginalization, where  we quantify the contribution of a single encoder by marginalizing over other variables. We find that the passage encoder contributes more than the question encoder to the in-domain retrieval accuracy. We further use an example to demonstrate how to find the affecting factors for each encoder, where we train multiple DPR models with different amounts of data and use encoder marginalization to analyze the results. We find that the positive passage overlap and corpus coverage of training data have big impacts on the passage encoder, while the question encoder is mainly affected by training sample complexity under this setting. Based on this framework, we can devise data-efficient training regimes: for example, we manage to train a  passage encoder on SQuAD using 60\% less training data without loss of accuracy. These results illustrate the utility of our encoder attribution analysis.",january,True,6.768323962238163,17.008334505255345

In this work, we explore the benefits of quasi-character-level models for low-resource NMT and their ability to mitigate the effects of the catastrophic forgetting problem. We first present a theoretical foundation along with an empirical study on the effectiveness of these models, as a function of the vocabulary and training set size, for a range of languages, domains, and architectures. Next, we study the ability of these models to mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting in machine translation.

Captions should cover the characteristic details of input images. However, recent high-performing captioning models that are trained with reinforcement learning (RL) tend to generate overly generic captions despite their high performance in various other criteria. Interestingly, it has also been reported that their outputs are composed of a limited number of common words and rarely contain tail-class words, i.e., low-frequency words in the training corpus. Vocabulary size is closely related to distinctiveness as it is difficult for a model to describe details beyond its vocabulary. Based on this insight, we hypothesize that the limited vocabulary of RL models is the major factor limiting their distinctiveness. We recast distinctive image captioning as a simpler task of long-tail classification to increase the vocabulary and then propose lightweight fine-tuning methods to encourage tail-class word generation. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance the distinctiveness of existing RL models as well as their vocabulary size, without sacrificing quality.

However, most pre-trained models suffer from low inference speed. Deploying such large models to applications with latency constraints is challenging.

To achieve this, we propose a novel idea, Magic Pyramid (MP), to reduce both width-wise and depth-wise computation via token pruning and early exiting for Transformer-based models, particularly BERT. The former manages to save the computation via removing non-salient tokens, while the latter can fulfill the computation reduction by terminating the inference early before reaching the final layer, if the exiting condition is met. Our empirical studies demonstrate that compared to previous state of arts, MP is not only able to achieve a speed-adjustable inference, but also to surpass token pruning and early exiting by reducing up to 70\% giga floating point operations (GFLOPs) with less than 0.5\% accuracy drop.

Analysis of the surprisal values shows that rare proper nouns, which are typically tokenized into multiple subword tokens, are systematically assigned lower surprisal values by the larger GPT-2 models. A comparison of residual errors from regression models fit to reading times reveals that regression models with surprisal predictors from smaller GPT-2 models have significantly lower mean absolute errors on words that are tokenized into multiple tokens, while this trend is not observed on words that are kept intact. These results indicate that the ability of larger GPT-2 models to predict internal pieces of rare words more accurately makes their surprisal estimates deviate from humanlike expectations that manifest in self-paced reading times and eye-gaze durations.",january,True,0.681040116907549,-0.45480237193971546

Mortensen (2006) claims that (1) the linear ordering of EEs and CCs in Hmong, Lahu, and Chinese can be predicted via phonological hierarchies and (2) that these phonological hierarchies lack a clear phonetic rationale. These claims are significant because morphosyntax has often been seen as in a feed-forward relationship with phonology, and phonological generalizations have often been assumed to be phonetically ""natural"". We investigate whether the ordering of CCs and EEs can be learned empirically and whether computational models (classifiers and sequence-labeling models) learn unnatural hierarchies similar to those posited by Mortensen (2006). We find that decision trees and SVMs learn to predict the order of CCs/EEs on the basis of phonology, beating strong baselines for all three languages, with DTs learning hierarchies strikingly similar to those proposed by Mortensen. However, we also find that a neural sequence labeling model is able to learn the ordering of elaborate expressions in Hmong very effectively without using any phonological information.

iDLrO042IB,Answering Open-Domain Multi-Answer Questions via a Recall-then-Verify Framework,"Open-domain questions are likely to be open-ended and ambiguous, leading to multiple valid answers. Existing approaches typically adopt the rerank-then-read framework, where a reader reads top-ranking evidence to predict answers. According to our empirical analysis, this framework faces three problems: first, to leverage a large reader under a memory constraint, the reranker should select only a few relevant passages to cover diverse answers, while balancing relevance and diversity is non-trivial; second, the small reading budget prevents the reader from accessing valuable retrieved evidence filtered out by the reranker; third, when using a generative reader to predict answers all at once based on all selected evidence, whether a valid answer will be predicted also pathologically depends on evidence of some other valid answer(s). To address these issues, we propose to answer open-domain multi-answer questions with a recall-then-verify framework, which separates the reasoning process of each answer so that we can make better use of retrieved evidence while also leveraging large models under the same memory constraint. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-answer datasets, and predicts significantly more gold answers than a rerank-then-read system that uses an oracle reranker.",january,True,4.838828383579081,20.097417707876758

However, most domain adaptation methods focus on fine-tuning or training the entire or part of the model on every new domain, which can be costly. On the other hand, semi-parametric models have been shown to successfully perform domain adaptation by retrieving examples from an in-domain datastore (Khandelwal et al., 2021).  A drawback of these retrieval-augmented models, however, is that they tend to be substantially slower.  In this paper, we explore several approaches to speed up nearest neighbors machine translation.  We adapt the methods recently proposed by He et al.

This QA-based signal is incorporated into a two-stage summarization model which first marks salient NPs in the input document using a classification model, then conditionally generates a summary. Our experiments demonstrate that the models trained using QA-based supervision generate higher-quality summaries than baseline methods of identifying salient spans on benchmark summarization datasets. Further, we show that the content of the generated summaries can be controlled based on which NPs are marked in the input document. Finally, we propose a method of augmenting the training data so the gold summaries are more consistent with the marked input spans used during training and show how this results in models which learn to better exclude unmarked document content.",january,True,7.341441176888691,30.105032769804254

Trained on large parallel corpora, these models can generate more logical event sequences and thus more contentful stories. However, these intermediate representations are often not in natural language and cannot be utilized by PLMs without fine-tuning. We propose generating story plots using off-the-shelf PLMs while maintaining the benefit of content planning to generate cohesive and contentful stories. Our proposed method, ScratchPlot, first prompts a PLM to compose a content plan. Then, we generate the story's body and ending conditioned on the content plan.

Yet, little is known about how they blend information stored in their LM parameters with that from retrieved evidence documents. We study this by simulating knowledge conflicts (i.e., where parametric knowledge suggests one answer and different passages suggest different answers). We find that retrieval performance largely decides which knowledge source models use, and a state-of-the-art model barely relies on parametric knowledge when given multiple passages. When presented with passages suggesting multiple answers, however, models use parametric knowledge to break the ties. We discover a troubling trend that contradictions in diverse knowledge sources affect model confidence only marginally.

Moreover, over-training on data that are properly handled may poison the model. Inspired by human pedagogy, we propose a teacher-aware learning structure for token classification models. After each epoch of training, the teacher selects data it is uncertain of and data it predicts differently from the student, which are passed into the structure for training in the next epoch. As a proof of concept, we use a Bayesian linear classifier as the teacher and two commonly used backbone models as the student.

We train bilingual sub-word embeddings and provide evidence to show that our bilingual embeddings improve overall accuracy compared to the publicly-available monolingual embeddings. This improvement has been verified for various NLP tasks using three bilingual databases containing formal transcripts and informal social media data.

To address the problem, we propose a unified framework to extend the existing gradient-based method to craft textual adversarial samples. In this framework, gradient-based continuous perturbations are added to the embedding layer and amplified in the forward propagation process. Then the final perturbed latent representations are decoded with a mask language model head to obtain potential adversarial samples.  In this paper, we instantiate our framework with an attack algorithm named Textual Projected GradientDescent (T-PGD). We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our framework by performing transfer black-box attacks on BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT on three benchmark datasets.

Pre-trained language models (PLMs) based methods have yielded significant improvements on this task. The sequence representation plays a key role in the learning of matching degree between the dialogue context and the response. However, we observe that different context-response pairs sharing the same context always have a greater similarity in the sequence representations calculated by PLMs, which makes it hard to distinguish positive responses from negative ones. Motivated by this, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Contrastive (FGC) learning method for the response selection task based on PLMs. This FGC learning strategy helps PLMs to generate more distinguishable matching representations of each dialogue at fine grains, and further make better predictions on choosing positive responses.

In this study, we investigate the robustness of visually grounded dialog models towards textual attacks to understand how different input components can mitigate the attack. Our results show that dialog history is important for model robustness: models encoding history are more robust, and when launching an attack on history, model prediction becomes more uncertain. This is in contrast to prior work which finds that dialog history is negligible for model performance. We also evaluate how to generate adversarial examples which successfully attack the model but remain undetected by the user.

E-commerce query understanding often uses query rewriting to disambiguate user-input queries. While using e-commerce search tools, users tend to enter multiple searches, which we call context, before purchasing. These history searches contain contextual insights about users' true shopping intents. Therefore, modeling such contextual information is critical to a better query rewriting model.  However, existing query rewriting models ignore users' history behaviors and consider only the instant search query, which is often a short string offering limited information about the true shopping intent.  We propose an end-to-end context-aware query rewriting model to bridge this gap, which takes the search context into account. Specifically, our model builds a session graph using the history search queries, their contained words, and auxiliary category information. We then employ a weighted graph attention mechanism that models cross-query relations and computes contextual information of the session. The model subsequently calculates session representations by combining the contextual information with the instant search query using an aggregation network. The session representations are then decoded to generate rewritten queries. Empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art approaches under various evaluation metrics. Our code and data will be publicly available.",january,True,-5.890045906442942,15.011458853974112

We found that it is feasible to prompt a GPT-3 PLM to generate meaningful analogies and the best prompts tend to be precise imperative statements especially with low temperature setting.  We systematically analyzed the sensitivity of the GPT-3 model to prompt design and temperature and found that the model is particularly sensitive to certain variations (e.g., questions vs. imperative statements). We also investigated the suitability of using the existing reference-based metrics designed for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) to evaluate analogy generation and found that the recent BLEURT score is better than the others. We further propose a promising consensus measure based on diverse prompts and settings, which can be potentially used to both automatically evaluate the generated analogies in the absence of reference text (e.g., in novel domains) and rank a set of generated analogies to select analogies of different characteristics. Overall, our study shows that PLMs offer a promising new way to generate analogies in unrestricted domains, breaking the limitation of existing analogy generation methods in requiring structured representation.

Existing attempts on BT share a common characteristic: they employ either beam search or random sampling to generate synthetic data with a backward model but seldom work studies the role of synthetic data in the performance of BT. This motivates us to ask a fundamental question: what kind of synthetic data contributes to BT performance? Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we identify two key factors on synthetic data controlling the back-translation NMT performance, which are quality and importance. Furthermore, based on our findings, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate synthetic data to better trade off both factors so as to yield the better performance for BT. We run extensive experiments on WMT14 DE-EN, EN-DE, and RU-EN benchmark tasks.

In this paper, we try to improve the performance of Extractive Document Summarization (EDS) for long-form documents based on the concept of HeterGNN. Specifically, long documents (e.g., Scientific Papers) are truncated for most neural-based models, which leads to the challenge in terms of information loss of inter-sentence relations. In this regard, we present a new method by exploiting the capabilities of HeterGNN and pre-trained language models. Particularly, BERT is considered for improving the sentence information into the Heterogenous graph layer. Accordingly, two versions of the proposed method are presented which are: i) Multi Graph Neural Network (MTGNN-SUM), by combining both heterogeneous graph layer and graph attention layer; and ii) HeterGNN with BERT (HeterGNN-BERT-SUM), by integrating BERT directly into the heterogeneous graph structure.

Such success can give the impression that prompts help models to learn faster in the same way that humans learn faster when provided with task instructions expressed in natural language. In this study, we experiment with over 30 prompts manually written for natural language inference (NLI). We find that models learn just as fast with many prompts that are intentionally irrelevant or even pathologically misleading as they do with instructively “good” prompts. Further, such patterns hold even for models as large as 175 billion parameters (Brown et al., 2020) as well as the recently proposed instruction-tuned models which are trained on hundreds of prompts (Sanh et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021). Despite some success, instruction-tuned models are capable of producing good predictions with misleading prompts even at zero shots.

In this work, we seek to answer one research question: can we train a BERT model to solve logical reasoning problems written in natural language? We study this problem on a confined problem space and train a BERT model on randomly drawn data. However, we report a rather surprising finding: even if BERT achieves nearly perfect accuracy on the test data, it only learns an incorrect and partial reasoning function; further investigation shows that the behaviour of the model (i.e., the learned partial reasoning function) is unreasonably sensitive to the training data.

Such methods usually consist of a learner as the classifier and a meta learner for specializing the learner to tasks. For the learner, learning rate is crucial to its performance. However, existing methods treat it as a hyper parameter and adjust it manually, which is time-consuming and laborious. Intuitively, for different tasks and neural network layers, the learning rates should be different and self-adaptive. For the meta learner, it requires a good generalization ability so as to quickly adapt to new tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel meta learning framework, called MetaCLSLR, for few-shot text classification. Specifically, we present a novel meta learning mechanism to obtain different learning rates for different tasks and neural network layers so as to enable the learner to quickly adapt to new training data. Moreover, we propose a task-oriented curriculum learning mechanism to help the meta learner achieve a better generalization ability by learning from different tasks with increasing difficulties.

However, there is still very little comparable research in speech recognition for African languages. Interestingly, some of the unique properties of African languages affecting NLP, like their diacritical and tonal complexities, have a major root in their speech, suggesting that careful speech interpretation could provide more intuition on how to deal with the linguistic complexities of African languages for text-based NLP.

It is promising to leverage the rich label semantics in label words for data augmentation to facilitate prompt-based tuning for the downstream NLU tasks. However, the work on this is rather limited. Therefore, we study a new problem of data augmentation for prompt-based few shot learners.

Adversarial training and certified robust training have shown some effectiveness in improving the robustness of machine learnt models to oversensitive adversarial examples. However, recent work has shown that using these techniques to improve robustness for image classifiers may make a model more vulnerable to undersensitive adversarial examples.  We demonstrate the same phenomenon applies to NLP models, showing that training methods that improve robustness to synonym-based attacks (oversensitive adversarial examples) tend to increase a model's vulnerability to antonym-based attacks (undersensitive adversarial examples) for both natural language inference and paraphrase identification tasks.

To deal with the second problem, we present a new user simulator model called U-GPT based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT).

To defend against these attacks, we propose to detect the attack trigger by examining the effect of deleting or replacing certain words on the generation outputs, which we find successful for certain types of attacks.

Drn7scCUrM,Towards Coherent and Captivating Topic Transitions in Knowledge-Grounded Conversations,"Knowledge-grounded conversations require skillful usage of knowledge to generate suitably diverse responses to keep user captivated while maintaining coherence to the dialogue context. However, current approaches that directly match knowledge with dialog context can result in capturing spurious correlations between knowledge and context, leading to either incoherent or mundane topic transitions in the generated dialogs that fail to engage. In this work, we introduce the Coherent and Captivating Topic Transition (C2T2) method to select the appropriate knowledge to be used in next response,  resulting in topic transitions that are coherent to the ongoing conversations while providing adequate topic development for an engaging dialog. Our C2T2 employs transition-aware features designed to consider both historical contextual coherence as well as sequential topic development under a knowledge shifting constraint to select the next knowledge, thereby generating the response for an engaging conversation.

HUW5H1n-ERu,Power Norm Based Lifelong Learning for Paraphrase Generations,"Seq2seq language generation models that are trained offline with multiple domains in a sequential fashion often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Lifelong learning has been proposed to handle this problem. However, existing work such as experience replay or elastic weighted consolidation requires incremental memory space. In this work, we propose an innovative framework, RMR_DSEthat leverages a recall optimization mechanism to selectively memorize important parameters of previous tasks via regularization, and uses a domain drift estimation algorithm to compensate the drift between different do-mains in the embedding space. These designs enable the model to be trained on the current task while keep-ing the memory of previous tasks, and avoid much additional data storage. Furthermore, RMR_DSE can be combined with existing lifelong learning approaches. Our experiments on two seq2seq language generation tasks, paraphrase and dialog response generation, show thatRMR_DSE outperforms SOTA models by a considerable margin and reduces forgetting greatly.",january,True,-13.822008967797704,-12.888230256962192

Training PLMs has incurred significant cost, but utilizing the few-shot learners is still challenging due to their enormous size. This work focuses on a crucial question: How to make effective use of these few-shot learners? We propose LMTurk, a novel approach that treats few-shot learners as crowdsourcing workers. The rationale is that crowdsourcing workers are in fact few-shot learners: They are shown a few illustrative examples to learn about a task and then start annotating. LMTurk employs few-shot learners built upon PLMs as workers. We show that the resulting annotations can be utilized to train models that solve the task well and are small enough to be deployable in practical scenarios. Altogether, LMTurk is an important step towards making effective use of current PLMs. ",january,True,-4.1805528705502235,-22.55665137027983

Therefore, the detection of individuals' personality traits has become a critical process for improving the performance of different tasks.

TO_7PHXMoUc,LongChecker: Improving scientific claim verification by modeling full-abstract context,"The spread of scientific mis- and dis-information has motivated the development of datasets and models for the task of scientific claim verification. We address two modeling challenges associated with this task. First, existing claim verification systems make predictions by extracting an evidentiary sentence (or sentences) from a larger context, and then predicting whether this sentence supports or refutes the claim in question. This can be problematic, since the meaning of the selected sentence may change when interpreted outside its original context. Second, given the difficulty of collecting high-quality fact-checking annotations in expert domains, there is an unaddressed need for methods to facilitate zero / few-shot domain adaptation. Motivated by these challenges, we develop LongChecker. Given a claim and evidence-containing abstract, LongChecker predicts a fact-checking label and identifies evidentiary sentences in a multi-task fashion based on a shared encoding of all available context. This approach enables LongChecker to perform domain adaptation by leveraging weakly-supervised in-domain data. We show that LongChecker achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, and conduct analysis to confirm that its strong performance is due to its ability to model full-abstract context.

tv612ry6_g9,Unbiased Math Word Problems Benchmark for Mitigating Solving Bias,"In this paper, we revisit the solving bias when evaluating models on current Math Word Problem (MWP) benchmarks. However, current solvers exist solving bias which consists of data bias and learning bias due to biased dataset and improper training strategy. Our experiments verify MWP solvers are easy to be biased by the biased training datasets which do not cover diverse questions for each problem narrative of all MWPs, thus a solver can only learn shallow heuristics rather than deep semantics for understanding problems. Besides, an MWP can be naturally solved by multiple equivalent equations while current datasets take only one of the equivalent equations as ground truth, forcing the model to match the labeled ground truth and ignoring other equivalent equations. Here, we first introduce a novel MWP dataset named UnbiasedMWP which is constructed by varying the grounded expressions in our collected data and annotating them with corresponding multiple new questions manually. Then, to further mitigate learning bias, we propose a Dynamic Target Selection (DTS) Strategy to dynamically select more suitable target expressions according to the longest prefix match between the current model output and candidate equivalent equations which are obtained by applying commutative law during training. The results show that our UnbiasedMWP has significantly fewer biases than its original data and other datasets, posing a promising benchmark for fairly evaluating the solvers' reasoning skills rather than matching nearest neighbors. And the solvers trained with our DTS achieve higher accuracies on multiple MWP benchmarks.",january,True,-20.728899851898166,-12.49221961712165

Our proposed novelties address two weaknesses in the literature. First, a recent method proposes to learn mention detection and then entity candidate selection, but relies on predefined sets of candidates. We use encoder-decoder autoregressive entity linking in order to bypass this need, and propose to train mention detection as an auxiliary task instead. Second, previous work suggests that re-ranking could help correct prediction errors. We add a new, auxiliary task, match prediction, to learn re-ranking. Without the use of a knowledge base or candidate sets, our model sets a new state of the art in two benchmark datasets of entity linking: COMETA in the biomedical domain, and AIDA-CoNLL in the news domain. We show through ablation studies that each of the two auxiliary tasks increases performance, and that re-ranking is an important factor to the increase.

In this paper, we present Continual Prompt Tuning, a parameter-efficient framework that not only avoids forgetting but also enables knowledge transfer between tasks. To avoid forgetting, we only learn and store a few prompt tokens' embeddings for each task while freezing the backbone pre-trained model. To achieve bi-directional knowledge transfer among tasks, we propose several techniques (continual prompt initialization, query fusion, and memory replay) to transfer knowledge from preceding tasks and a memory-guided technique to transfer knowledge from subsequent tasks.

Besides, they generally consider either user’s query reformulations or system’s rankings whereas previous findings show that user’s query behavior and knowledge change depending on the system’s results,  intertwine and affect each other  during  the completion of a search task.  In this paper, we explore the value of multi-view learning for generic and unsupervised session-aware query representation learning.  First, single-view query embeddings are obtained in separate  spaces from query reformulations and document ranking representations using transformers. Then, we investigate the use of linear (CCA)  and non linear (UMAP) multi-view learning methods, to align those spaces with the aim of revealing  similarity  traits  in the multi-view shared space. Experimental evaluation is carried out  in a query classification and session-based retrieval downstream tasks using respectively the KDD and TREC session datasets.

However, often these approaches exhibit low reliability to minor alterations of the test texts. One of the problems concerns topical biases in the training corpus, for example, the prevalence of words on a specific topic in a specific genre can trick the genre classifier to recognise any text on this topic in this genre. In order to mitigate this problem, we investigate techniques for attacking genre classifiers to understand the limitations of the transformer models and to improve their performance. While simple text attacks, such as those based on word replacement using keywords extracted by tf-idf, are not capable of deceiving powerful models like XLM-RoBERTa, we show that embedding-based algorithms which can replace some of the most ``significant'' words with words similar to them, for example, TextFooler, have the ability to influence model predictions in a significant proportion of cases.

Next, we show that only by fine-tuning the BERT model on enough simplistic sentences, simplification results can be improved and even outperform some of the competing supervised methods.

0DR74NlWR7u,FaiRR: Faithful and Robust Deductive Reasoning over Natural Language,"Transformers have been shown to be able to perform deductive reasoning on a logical rulebase containing rules and statements written in natural language. Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model's logical reasoning process. Currently, these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations, and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.",january,True,-2.4687403691647583,-1.5728539923693248

In this paper, we propose to use the machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework to bridge this gap. We formalize predicate disambiguation as multiple-choice machine reading comprehension, where the descriptions of candidate senses of a given predicate are used as options to select the correct sense. The chosen predicate sense is then used to determine the semantic roles for that predicate, and these semantic roles are used to construct the query for another MRC model for argument labeling. In this way, we are able to leverage both the predicate semantics and the semantic role semantics for argument labeling.

In this paper, we explore how this generation can be further controlled at decoding time to satisfy certain constraints (eg. being non-toxic, conveying certain emotions, using a specific writing style, etc.) without fine-tuning the LM. Precisely, we formalize constrained generation as a tree exploration process guided by a discriminator that indicates how well the associated sequence respects the constraint.  This approach, in addition to being easier and cheaper to train than fine-tuning the LM, allows to apply the constraint more finely and dynamically. We propose several original methods to search this generation tree, notably the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which provides theoretical guarantees on the search efficiency, but also simpler methods based on re-ranking a pool of diverse sequences using the discriminator scores.  These methods are evaluated, with automatic and human-based metrics, on two types of constraints and languages: review polarity and emotion control in French and English.

Our explanation is that MLM pretraining may alleviate problems brought by simplicity bias (Shah et al., 2020), which refers to the phenomenon that a deep model tends to rely excessively on simple features. In NLP tasks, those simple features could be token-level features whose spurious association with the label can be learned easily. We show that MLM pretraining makes learning from the context easier. Thus, pretrained models are less likely to rely excessively on a single token. We also explore the theoretical explanations of MLM’s efficacy in causal settings. Compared with Wei et al. (2021), we achieve similar results with milder assumption. Finally, we close the gap between our theories and real-world practices by conducting experiments on real-world tasks.

We focus on two types of such signals in English texts: factual gender information, which is a grammatical or semantic property, and gender bias, which is the correlation between a word and specific gender. We can disentangle the model’s embeddings and identify components encoding both information with probing. We aim to diminish the representation of stereotypical bias while preserving factual gender signal. Our filtering method shows that it is possible to decrease the bias of gender-neutral profession names without deteriorating language modeling capabilities. The findings can be applied to language generation and understanding to mitigate reliance on stereotypes while preserving gender agreement in coreferences.",january,True,13.417363559429923,-16.005386463989602

We show how a representative modern co-reference engine (Stanford's) handles these examples. Since every example in H&P is chosen to illustrate a point about English, and the authors provide text explaining the importance of the point, the error analyst has immediate access to a good proxy for relevant linguistic expertise.",january,True,-8.084534891785832,-9.290913972798021
CAMSwlHXtoJ,Consecutive Question Generation with Multitask Joint Reranking and Dynamic Rationale Search,"Automatic question generation (QG) aims to generate a set of questions for a given passage, and can be viewed as a dual task of question answering (QA). However, most current methods of QG tend to generate question by question independently, mainly based on specific extracted answer spans. In this paper, we propose to consecutively generate questions over a whole passage, with a comprehensive consideration of the aspects including accuracy, diversity, informativeness, and coverage. First we exam four key elements in QG, i.e., question, answer, rationale, and context history, and propose a novel multitask framework with one main task generating a question-answer pair, and four auxiliary tasks generating other elements alternately, improving model performance from all aspects through both joint training and reranking. Further, to learn the connection between questions and fully exploit the important information in every sentence, we propose a new consecutive generation strategy, which dynamically selects the rationales and searches for the best question series globally. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that our method can improve question generation significantly and benefit multiple related NLP tasks.",january,True,-1.048798926465277,16.230649699984816

DRGN operates on a given KG subgraph based on the question and answers entities and uses the relevance between the nodes to establish new edges dynamically for learning node representations in the graph network. Using the relevance between the graph nodes in learning representations helps the model to not only exploit the existing relationships in the KG subgraph but also recover the missing edges. Moreover, our model improves handling the negative questions due to considering the relevance between the global question node and the graph entities.

While common in all forms of writing, exemplification is particularly useful in the task of long-form question answering (LFQA), where a complicated answer can be made more understandable through simple examples. In this paper, we provide the first computational study of exemplification in QA, performing a fine-grained annotation of different types of examples (e.g., hypotheticals, anecdotes) in three corpora. We show that not only do state-of-the-art LFQA models struggle to generate relevant examples, but also that standard evaluation metrics such as ROUGE are insufficient to judge exemplification quality. We propose to treat exemplification as a \emph{retrieval} problem in which a partially-written answer is used to query a large set of human-written examples extracted from a corpus. Our approach allows a reliable ranking-type automatic metrics that correlates well with human evaluation. Human evaluation shows that examples retrieved from our retriever are more relevant than examples generated from state-of-the-art LFQA model. ",january,True,-6.517625463109223,4.6992024838168325

Additionally, we propose techniques to re-purpose existing dialogue datasets for target-guided generation. Experiments reveal that the proposed techniques outperform various baselines on this task.

But when it comes to neural machine translation, things are a little different. The differences between the embedding spaces created by BERT and NMT encoder may be one of the main reasons for the difficulty of integrating pre-trained LMs into NMT models. Previous studies illustrate the best way of integration is introducing the output of BERT into the encoder with some extra modules. Nevertheless, it is still unrevealed whether these additional modules will affect the embedding spaces created by the NMT encoder or not and what kind of information the NMT encoder takes advantage of from the output of BERT. In this paper, we start by comparing the changes of embedding spaces after introducing BERT into the NMT encoder trained on different machine translation tasks. Although the changing trends of these embedding spaces vary, introducing BERT into the NMT encoder will not affect the space of the last layer significantly. Subsequent evaluation on several semantic and syntactic tasks proves the NMT encoder is facilitated by the rich syntactic information contained in the output of BERT to boost the translation quality.",january,True,20.28730478676075,-30.87504945571002

However, PT requires much more training time than fine-tuning. Intuitively, knowledge transfer can help to improve the efficiency. To explore whether we can improve PT via prompt transfer, we empirically investigate the transferability of soft prompts across different downstream tasks and PLMs in this work. We find that (1) in zero-shot setting, trained soft prompts can effectively transfer to similar tasks and other PLMs with a trained projector on similar tasks; (2) as initialization, trained soft prompts and projected prompts can significantly accelerate training and also improve performance of PT in similar tasks and other PLMs respectively. Moreover, to explore what decides prompt transferability, we investigate various transferability indicators and find that the overlapping rate of activated neurons strongly reflects the transferability, which suggests how the prompts stimulate PLMs is essential for transferability. Our findings show that prompt transfer is promising for improving PT, and further research shall focus more on prompts' stimulation to PLMs. The source code will be publicly released.",january,True,-5.011932707871264,-25.863225874982028

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences, which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: entire paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently.

To this end, it is important not only to correct grammatical errors but also to improve readability and perspicuity, through means such as conjunction insertion and sentence reordering. However, it is difficult to prepare enough the matched dataset for the document revision task since this task has to consider multiple perspectives simultaneously. To mitigate this problem, our idea is to utilize not only a limited matched dataset but also various partially-matched datasets that handles individual perspectives, e.g., correcting grammatical errors or inserting conjunctions. Since suitable partially-matched datasets have either been published or can easily be made, we expect to prepare a large amount of these partially-matched datasets.

However, the XMC setup faces two challenges: (1) it is not generalizable to predict unseen labels in dynamic environments, and (2) it requires a large amount of supervised (instance, label) pairs, which can be difficult to obtain for emerging domains. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario called Extreme Zero-Shot XMC (EZ-XMC), in which no supervision is needed and merely raw text of instances and labels are accessible. Few-Shot XMC (FS-XMC), an extension to EZ-XMC with limited supervision is also investigated. To learn the semantic embeddings of instances and labels with raw text, we propose to pre-train Transformer-based encoders with self-supervised contrastive losses.

Experimental results on four public EZ-XMC datasets demonstrate that MACLR achieves superior performance compared to all other leading baseline methods, in particular with approximately 5-10% improvement in precision and recall on average.

Given this observation, it is remarkable that explicit interaction plays little to no role in artificial language modeling---which also targets the acquisition of human language, yet by artificial models. Moreover, an interactive approach to language modeling has the potential to make language models substantially more versatile and to considerably impact downstream applications. Motivated by these considerations, we pioneer the space of interactive language modeling. First we present a road map in which we detail the steps that need to be taken towards interactive language modeling. We then lead by example and take the first steps on this road map, showing the initial feasibility of our approach. As such, this work aims to be the start of a larger research agenda on interactive language modeling.",january,True,1.2710031774678778,9.314020027527933

pK5HUWE-mz5,Efficient Weighted Deduction Systems for Earley’s Algorithm,"The parsing algorithm of Earley (1970), as presented, has a runtime complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^3\lvert\mathcal{G}\rvert \lvert\mathcal{R}\rvert)$ where $N$ is the length of the sentence, $\lvert\mathcal{G}\rvert $ is the size of the grammar, and $\lvert\mathcal{R}\rvert$ is the number of productions in the grammar. This is unworkable for the large grammars that arise in natural language processing. Fortunately, the dynamic programming algorithm can be improved to run in time $\mathcal{O}(N^3\lvert\mathcal{G}\rvert)$, matching the complexity of running CKY on a binarized version of $\mathcal{G}$. Some of the necessary speed-ups have been presented in part or in full in various parts of the literature. However, there has been no unified, formal treatment that is written as a deduction system or covers the weighted case. We present such a treatment in terms of five proof rules that can be used in weighted deduction, which refine Earley's \predict, \scan and \complete actions. We also provide a generalization of Earley's algorithm that uses a finite-state automaton to represent the grammar, and whose runtime is proportional to the size of the automaton (and the usual $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ term), or more precisely the size of the portion of the automaton that is reached while parsing the input sentence.  Further speed-ups can then be achieved by minimizing the automaton so that similar productions share transitions.",january,True,-9.789542714153232,-13.210313420586925

Dj9d8N5i5y,HiStruct+: Improving Extractive Text Summarization with Hierarchical Structure Information,"Transformer-based language models usually treat texts as linear sequences. However, most texts also have an inherent hierarchical structure, i.,e., parts of a text can be identified using their position in this hierarchy. In addition, section titles usually indicate the common topic of their respective sentences. We propose a novel approach to extract, encode and inject hierarchical structure (HiStruct) information into an extractive summarization model (HiStruct+ model) based on a pre-trained, encoder-only language model. Our HiStruct+ model achieves SOTA extractive ROUGE scores on three public summarization datasets (CNN/DailyMail, PubMed, arXiv), the improvement is especially substantial on PubMed and arXiv. Using various experimental settings, our HiStruct+ model outperforms a strong baseline, which differs from our model only in that the HiStruct information is not injected. The ablation study demonstrates that the hierarchical position information is the main contributor to our model's SOTA performance.",january,True,16.785895365927157,9.534123876171764
8v_Uc_w4vUt,$Great~Truths~are ~Always ~Simple:$ A Rather Simple Knowledge Encoder for Enhancing the Commonsense Reasoning Capacity of Pre-Trained Models,"Commonsense reasoning in natural language is a desired capacity  of artificial intelligent systems. For solving complex commonsense reasoning tasks, a typical approach is to enhance pre-trained language models~(PTM) by a knowledge-aware graph neural network~(GNN) encoder that leverages commonsense knowledge graphs~(CSKGs). Despite the effectiveness, these approaches are built in heavy architectures, and can't clearly explain how external knowledge resources improve the reasoning capacity of PTMs.  Considering this issue, we conduct deep empirical analysis, and find that it is indeed \emph{relation features} from CSKGs (but not \emph{node features}) that mainly contribute to the performance improvement of PTM. Based on this finding,  we design a simple MLP-based knowledge encoder by utilizing statistical relation paths as features.  Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which also largely reduces the parameters for encoding CSKGs.",january,True,-4.94222277427429,2.677907262668816
PNUMO7p7SoC,Product Answer Generation from Heterogeneous Sources: A New Benchmark and Best Practices,"It is of great value to answer product questions based on heterogeneous information sources available on web product pages, e.g., semi-structured attributes, text descriptions, user-provided contents, etc. However, these sources have different structures and writing styles, which poses challenges for (1) evidence ranking, (2) source selection, and (3) answer generation. In this paper, we  build a benchmark with annotations for both evidence selection and answer generation covering 6 information sources. Based on this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive study and present a set of best practices. We show that all sources are important and contribute to answering questions. Handling all sources within one single model can produce comparable confidence scores across sources and combining multiple sources for training always helps, even for sources with totally different structures. We further propose a  novel data augmentation method to iteratively create training samples for answer generation, which achieves close-to-human performance with only a few thousand annotations. Finally, we perform an in-depth error analysis of model predictions and highlight the challenges for future research.",january,True,4.671746731437693,17.964522204561288
